# Blogs and social media

More
and more, we communicate with customers through blogs,
communities, and other forms of social media. These forms of
communication tend to be shorter, more spontaneous, and
more frequent than the formal content we relied on in the
past. Plus, they often allow readers to contribute. 

This section will help you manage blogs and other social media and grow communities.
