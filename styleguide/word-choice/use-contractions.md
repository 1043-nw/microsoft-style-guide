# Use contractions

Write using the same, everyday words you use in conversation. 

  - Use common contractions, such as *it’s*, *you’re*, *that's,* and *don’t*, to create a friendly, informal tone.
  - Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don’t use *can’t* and *cannot* in the same UI.
  - Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as *Microsoft’s developing a lot of new cloud services.
    *
  - Avoid ambiguous contractions, such as *there’d, it’ll,* and *they’ll*.
