 Using precise verbs in the right way helps you write clear and simple sentences.

#### Verb tense

In
the present tense, the action is happening now. The present tense
is often easier to read and understand than the past or future
tense. It’s the best choice for most content. 

Examples
The Windows Start screen is uniquely yours, personalized with your favorite apps, people, photos, and colors. 
Windows Update installs important updates automatically.

#### Mood of verbs

The
mood of a verb expresses the writer’s intent. Most of the time,
use the indicative mood. It’s crisp and straightforward without
being bossy. Don’t switch moods within a sentence.

Active and passive voice

Voice is either active or passive. Keep it active whenever you can.

  - In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. 
  - In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

agrees with subject of the sentence in number.
