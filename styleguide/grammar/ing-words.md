A word ending in *–ing* can be a verb, a noun, or an adjective. Use *–ing* words with care. The sentence should make it clear which role the word plays. 

For example, we don’t know whether the heading, *Meeting requirements, *will be a discussion of how to meet requirements or the requirements for a meeting. These examples are clearer:

  - The meeting requirements
  - Meeting the requirements
  - The requirements for the meeting
  - How to meet the requirements
