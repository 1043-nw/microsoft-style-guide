# Grammar and parts of speech

Simple
grammar tends to be easy to read and understand, like a
conversation. That basic grammar you learned before you were 12 is
probably just right for most Microsoft content. 

This section covers common grammatical issues:

  - [Verbs](/style-guide/grammar/verbs) 
  - [Person](/style-guide/grammar/person) 
  - [Nouns and pronouns](/style-guide/grammar/nouns-pronouns#_Plural_nouns) 
  - [Words ending in *â€“ing*](/style-guide/grammar/ing-words) 
  - [Prepositions](/style-guide/grammar/prepositions) 
  - [Dangling and misplaced modifiers](/style-guide/grammar/dangling-misplaced-modifiers) 

**Learn more** For more information about grammar and parts of speech, see *[The Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html)*. If you have Microsoft network access, you can use [*The Chicago Manual of Style Online*](http://aka.ms/mslibrary/cms) through MS Library.
