# Grammar and parts of speech

Simple
grammar tends to be easy to read and understand, like a
conversation. That basic grammar you learned before you were 12 is
probably just right for most Microsoft content. 

This section covers common grammatical issues:

  - [Verbs](/style-guide/grammar/verbs) 
  - [Person](/style-guide/grammar/person) 
  - [Nouns and pronouns](/style-guide/grammar/nouns-pronouns) 
  - [Words ending in *â€“ing*](/style-guide/grammar/ing-words) 
  - [Prepositions](/style-guide/grammar/prepositions) 
  - [Dangling and misplaced modifiers](/style-guide/grammar/dangling-misplaced-modifiers)
