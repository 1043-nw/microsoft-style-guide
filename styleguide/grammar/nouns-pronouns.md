# Nouns and pronouns

## Capitalization and proper nouns

Proper nouns are one of a kind—unique people, places, and things. Capitalize proper nouns wherever they occur. 

Proper nouns include:

  - Names and titles of individuals.  
  
  - Unique, named places, organizations, events, shows, corporate and philanthropic programs, and other things.  
  
  - Product, service, app, and tool names.  
  
  - Trademarks.  
  
  - Titles of books, songs, and other published works.  
  
  - Managed standards, such as Bluetooth.

If there's more than one of a thing, it’s a common noun. For example, there are lots of chief operating officers, so *chief operating officer* is a common noun. There’s only one *Latasha Sharp, Chief Operating Officer,* so that’s a proper noun. 

Don’t
capitalize common nouns unless they begin a sentence or the situation
calls for title-style capitalization. Most technology
concepts, product categories, devices, and features are common
nouns, not proper nouns. Examples of common nouns include *cloud computing, smartphone, e-commerce,* and *open source.*

Capitalize technology terms as proper nouns only when:

  - You
    need to distinguish a component or product, such as SQL Server,
    from a general technology with a similar name, such as an SQL
    database server.  
    
  - The terms are typically capitalized in the industry. Search *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/),* reputable internet sites, and industry-specific dictionaries. Don’t rely on unedited websites. 

If you’re not sure whether a term is a proper noun (and thus capitalized) or a common noun (lowercase), check *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/)* and the A–Z word list. Default to lowercase unless there's a compelling reason to capitalize the term.

**Learn more** For guidelines for sentence-style and title-style capitalization, see [Capitalization](/style-guide/capitalization).

## Plural nouns

Some nouns can be challenging to use in the plural. The simple rules that follow will help. 

To
check the spelling of plural forms of words derived from Latin and
Greek that retain their Latin or Greek endings (typically *-a, -us, -um, -on, -ix,* or -*ex*), see specific entries in the A–Z word list and *[The American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/).*

**Noun**|**Plural form**|**Examples**
--|--|--
Common and proper nouns ending in *s*|If the noun ends in *s,* add *es.*|the Johnsons<br />the Joneses<br />biases
Singular abbreviation|Add an *s,* even if the abbreviation ends in *s.*|ISVs<br />DBMSs
Plural abbreviation|If an abbreviation already represents a plural, don’t add an *s.*|*MFC* (Microsoft Foundation Classes)
Single letter|Add an apostrophe and an *s.*<br />The letter itself (but not the apostrophe or the ending *s*) is italic.|*x*'s
Number|Add an *s.*|the 1950s
Variable|Don’t add *(s)* to a word to indicate that it could be either singular or plural unless you have no other choice. Use the plural form instead.|Wait for *x* minutes.


## Pronouns and gender

Don’t use *he* and *his* in references to a person whose gender is unknown. Instead, rewrite to use the second person (*you*). Or refer to a person’s role (reader, employee, or client, for example), or simply use *person* or *individual.*<br />
**Examples**<br />If you have the appropriate rights, you can set other users’ passwords.<br />A user with the appropriate rights can set other users’ passwords.<br />Select the name of the person you want to call, select **Make a phone call**, and then choose a phone number.

If you can’t write around the problem, it’s OK to occasionally:

  - Use the plural pronouns *they* or *their* to refer to a single person.  
  
  - Use *he or she.*  
  
  - Use *he* for some individuals and *she* for others in the same topic. 

Don’t alternate between masculine and feminine pronouns to refer to the same individual, and don’t use *he/she* or *s/he*.

## Noun and pronoun agreement

Use a singular pronoun when the noun is singular, and a plural pronoun when the noun is plural. Collective nouns like *company* take a singular pronoun. Don’t use a plural pronoun (like *they*).<br />
**Examples**<br />Meet with up to 250 people. All they need is a phone or internet connection.<br />The company upgraded its cloud storage solution to Microsoft Azure.

**Exception** If the emphasis is on the individuals in a group, it’s OK to use a plural pronoun with a singular noun.
