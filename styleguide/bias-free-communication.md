Microsoft technology reaches every part of the globe—so it’s critical that all our communications are inclusive and diverse.

Use gender-neutral or inclusive terms to refer to people.

Avoid masculine pronouns. Don’t use *he* and *his* in references to a person whose gender is unknown. Instead, rewrite to use *the* instead of *his* or the second person (*you*). Or refer to a person’s role (reader, employee, or client, for example), or simply use *person* or *individual.* For more information, see [Nouns and pronouns](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25525).

Examples 
If you have the appropriate rights, you can set other users’ passwords.
A user with the appropriate rights can set other users' passwords.
Select the name of the person, select Make a phone call, and then choose the number you'd like to dial.

Don’t use slang, especially if it could be considered profane or derogatory, such as *pimp* or *bitch*. 

**In fictitious scenarios, use a variety of names****,**
both male and female, that reflect various
cultural backgrounds. To find legally approved names for scenarios
and examples, visit [Approved fictitious names and guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Fictitious-Names) on CELAWeb. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Be conscious of stereotypes in job roles. For
example, in fictitious scenarios, use male and female names from a
variety of cultures for leadership and technical roles. 

**In text and images, represent diverse perspectives and circumstances.** Depict a variety of people from all walks of life participating fully in activities. Be
inclusive of gender, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation,
and socioeconomic class. Show people in a wide variety
of professions, educational settings, locales, and economic settings. Avoid using examples that reflect primarily a Western or affluent lifestyle. In drawings or blueprints of buildings, show ramps for wheelchair accessibility. 

Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, leisure activities, and purchasing power. If you show various family groupings, consider showing nontraditional and extended families. 

Be mindful when you refer to various parts of the world. If
you name cities, countries, or regions in examples, make sure
they're not politically disputed. In examples that refer to several
regions, use equivalent references—for example, don’t mix
countries with states or continents.

Don’t make generalizations about people, countries, regions, and cultures, not even positive or neutral generalizations. 

Avoid culturally sensitive terms, such as the terms associated with military or political actions or other historic events and eras.

Focus on people, not disabilities. For example, talk about readers who are blind or have low vision and customers with limited dexterity. Don’t use words that imply pity, such as *stricken with* or *suffering from.* Don’t mention a disability unless it's relevant.
