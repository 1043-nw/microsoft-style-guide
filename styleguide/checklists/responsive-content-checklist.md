  - Consider the order in which columns will display on a small screen.
  - Write short sections and short paragraphs—ideally, the reader should be able to see a full paragraph on the screen.
  - Limit headings to one short line.
  - Organize
    infographics in compact sections for mobile viewing, and provide a way
    for readers to open the infographic so they can enlarge areas.
  - Simplify charts and graphs, and write short chart titles and axis labels.
  - Limit the number of columns in a table.
