Double-check your work. Every detail—from facts to proper
usage and placement of punctuation marks—makes a difference. Clear, accurate
content that’s free of spelling and grammar mistakes is easy to read and builds trust in Microsoft's commitment to quality.

  - Always rewrite, edit, and proofread. Even better, have someone else check your work. 
  - Read it out aloud, backward and forward. Potential problems and edits will jump out.
  - Read only the headings or the first sentence of every paragraph. Do they tell a story? 
  - Frontload keywords in titles and headings.
  - Eliminate every repetitive or redundant element.
  - Excise adverbs (words describing how, when, and where). 
  - Evaluate the personality—your writing should sound like a person, not a robot. Learn more about the [Microsoft voice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361 "Brand voice").
  - Take things out. If you don’t miss them, leave them out.
  - If you have to read anything twice, simplify it or take it out.
  - Reread your original objectives. Did you meet them?
  - Leave your copy alone for a day. Then give it a final read with a fresh perspective.
  - Pay attention to [legal requirements](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26694) and [c](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Marketing/Marketing-and-Advertising-Content/Quotes)[ite quotations and references](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Marketing/Marketing-and-Advertising-Content/Quotes). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Use a spelling and grammar checker. But check each recommendation before you accept it—only you know whether you mean *manager* or *manger*.
