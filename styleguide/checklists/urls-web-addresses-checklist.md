# URLs and web addresses checklist

Follow these guidelines to refer to URLs and other addresses clearly and consistently. For detailed guidance, see [URLs and web addresses](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=34905).

  - Most of the time, use lowercase for URLs, email addresses, and newsgroup addresses.
    Exception
    To refer generally to a website or domain, such as Microsoft.com, capitalize only the first letter of the URL, even if the site name is capitalized differently.
  - Don't include *http://* in a URL. Include other protocols, such as *ftp://.
    *
  - Don't include a slash at the end of a URL.
  - Use *web address,* not *URL,* for a general audience. For a technical audience, it's OK to use *URL,* but don't spell it out on the first mention.
  - Write short, specific, and informative link text. In alt text for a graphical link, state that the graphic is a link.
  - Use *of* (not *for*) to describe the relationship of the word *URL* to a resource.
    Example the URL of the page
  - Use the preposition *at* with the location of a specific address.
    Example at [www.microsoft.com](http://www.microsoft.com/)
  - Use *a* as an article preceding *URL.
    *
  - If punctuation follows a URL, make sure it's clear that the punctuation isn't part of the URL.
