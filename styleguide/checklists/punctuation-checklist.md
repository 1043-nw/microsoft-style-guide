# Punctuation checklist

Keep it simple.

  - Stick to short, simple sentences. Sentences that contain lots of punctuation tend to be complex and hard to read. 
  - End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words.
  - Use only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation marks, and colons.

  - Include a colon at the end of a phrase that directly introduces a list.
      - If
        one or more list elements complete the introductory phrase
        preceding the colon, use a period after every list element. 
      - If
        all list elements are short phrases (three words or fewer), don’t
        end them with periods, even if they form a complete sentence
        together with the list introduction. 
      - If
        one or more list elements are complete sentences, use a period
        after every element, even if a list element contains three or fewer
        words.

  - Include commas after every item in a series, including the last one.
    Example networks, storage, and virtual machines
    You might know that extra comma as the Oxford comma. [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/commas).[

  - Use a comma following an introductory phrase, to join independent clauses with a conjunction, and to surround the year when you use a complete date within a sentence. [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/commas).
  - Use an apostrophe to indicate a missing letter in a contraction (such as *don’t*) and to form the possessive case of a noun (as in *Insider’s Guide*). Don’t use an apostrophe for the possessive of *it* *(its)* to avoid confusion with the contraction *it’s.* [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/apostrophes).[

  - When
    you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows
    it unless it's a proper noun or the first word of a quotation.

  - A
    sentence that contains a semicolon might be complex. Try to
    rewrite the sentence as multiple sentences or break it into a list. [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/semicolons).
  - Use exclamation points sparingly. Save them for when they count.
  - Use question marks sparingly. Customers expect *us* to give *them* answers. [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/question-marks).[

  - Place closing quotation marks:
      - Outside commas and periods.
      - Inside other punctuation.

Exception If punctuation is part of the quoted material, place it inside the quotation marks.

  - In general, don’t use hyphens unless leaving them out could result in confusion. [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens).[

  - Don’t use spaces around em dashes (—). [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/emes).[

  - Don’t use a slash (/) to indicate a choice or as a substitute for *or.* [Learn more](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/slashes).
  - In
    general, format punctuation in the same font style as the main
    content of a sentence or phrase unless it's part of an element such as a command, option, keyword, placeholder, hyperlink, pop-up text, or user input.
