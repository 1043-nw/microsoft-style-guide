# New products checklist

  - Follow the five-step, formal naming process when you're developing a new name. [Learn more](/style-guide/new-products/name-development).
  - Use *preview*, not *beta*, to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Lowercase *preview* in generic references.
  - Use *Product Name Preview*, if possible, to refer to prerelease versions of software and services. [Learn more](/style-guide/new-products/product-previews).
  - Follow CELAWeb [Code name guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Code-Names) before you create or use code names for existing products, new offerings, or acquisitions. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Get all required approvals before using code names in external communications. [Learn more](/style-guide/new-products/code-names). 
  - Avoid using code names in documentation. 
  - Provide accurate system requirements for all products, including trial, evaluation, and preview products and products and services obtained digitally. [Learn more](/style-guide/new-products/system-requirements).
