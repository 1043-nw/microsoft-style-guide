A little upfront planning will save you time and keep your writing focused. 

  - Understand your audience: who they are, what they need, and where they look for content.
  - Consider your business objectives for the content, in addition to time and budget constraints.
  - Plan for a great experience across the devices customers will use to experience the content.
  - Plan to help customers find the content.
  - Decide what kind of content best meets the customer's needs and business objectives.
  - Take steps to streamline translation and localization, if necessary. 
  - Decide how you will measure success before finalizing your plan.
