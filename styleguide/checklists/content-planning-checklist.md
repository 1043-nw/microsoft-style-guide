  - Consider your business objectives for the content, in addition to time and budget constraints.
  - Plan for a great experience across the devices customers will use to experience the content.
  - Plan to help customers find the content.

  - Take steps to streamline translation and localization, if necessary. 
  - Decide how you will measure success before finalizing your plan.
