# Security, safety, and privacy content checklist

Absolute security, privacy, and safety don't exist. When you write about these subjects, which are a big concern for many customers, be reassuring but realistic.

  - Don’t
    make absolute statements about security, safety, or privacy. When
    you talk about these subjects, avoid absolute verbs, such as *is,* *ensure, protect* (without a qualifier), *promise, guarantee,* or *secure.*

  - Avoid images that might imply absolute security, safety, or privacy, such as padlocks, fortresses, vaults, or safes. 

  - Use security terms properly. [Learn how.](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/security-safety-privacy-terms)

    knowledge of security technology and tolerance for risk in mind.

  - Request a review from [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) if your content is primarily about security, safety, or privacy, or if you have any questions. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
