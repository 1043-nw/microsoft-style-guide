[Well-designed UI feels like a conversation. These tips will help get you there. ]

#### [Be simple, straightforward, and human]

-   [Write in informal, conversational Microsoft voice. (Use short, everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization.) ]
-   [Read UI aloud. Is it conversational, clear, and concise? Keep revising until it is.]
-   [Don't use technical jargon or acronyms.]

#### [Put the customer at the center]

-   [Understand your customers. Then tailor the experience to their needs.  ]
-   [Design around the customer’s primary intent—what the customer is trying to accomplish.]
-   [Always consider the context and the customer’s frame of mind during a specific interaction.]
-   [Reach out to your usability researchers, and use their insights.]

#### [Design great content]

-   [Participate in the project kickoff. Advocate for the customer throughout.]
-   [Design for customer scenarios. Put the most important information, action, or issue in the most noticeable spot. ]
-   [Ban *lorem ipsum.* Always design with real, plausible text in the early stages. Then revise until it's just right.]
-   [Don’t get in the way. Great content is invisible. Prune every excess word and remove unnecessary details.]
-   [Consider what those button labels and words mean to customers. ][Make it clear what will happen when they choose an option or select a link. ]
-   [Use the same terms consistently for fundamental commands, menu items, and labels. ]
-   [Apply Microsoft voice guidelines until your text reads like a conversation with][ a friend. ][[To learn more, see ][Brand voice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361)[.]]
-   [Collaborate with design and PM partners, usability researchers, and peers to identify issues as you revise. ]
-   [Apply style rules. Sweat the details, like sentence-style capitalization and punctuation. To ][learn more, see [Capitalization](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28261)[ and ][Punctuation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25519)[.]]
-   [When something works, consider using it as a pattern you can reuse.]
-   [Keep a style sheet, and contribute to your UX team's guidance. ]
