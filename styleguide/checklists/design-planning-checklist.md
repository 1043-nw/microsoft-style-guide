# Design-planning checklist

Think about design before you start writing.

  - Stay in close touch with your designer, if you have one.
  - Understand design options and limitations if you’re writing blog posts or for social media.
  - If you’re starting from scratch without a designer, use a template. Check [Brand Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Search/Pages/BCTemplatesResults.aspx?k=microsoft) if your team doesn’t have a template. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) The Microsoft.com design template is available in the [Microsoft Web Framework](http://getmwf.com/). 
  - Make
    layout decisions before you start. If you're working on a platform with
    limited design choices, find out which layout works best. 
  - Position content elements in the same place on every page if you can.
