# Grammar and parts of speech checklist

As
creative as it is, the art of writing is governed by a set of rules
with a lot of built-in flexibility. This checklist covers rules
of grammar that are important in Microsoft content and how to apply
them. You’ll notice a preference for style and word choices that
are simple, straightforward, and human. That’s what makes us sound
like Microsoft—and helps you connect with customers.

These basic guidelines will get you started creating clear and useful content.

  - Use present-tense verbs—verbs that indicate the action is happening now, like *is* and *open.* Avoid *will, was,* and verbs ending in *–ed,* which indicate that text isn't in the present tense. [Learn more](/style-guide/grammar/verbs).
  
  - For most content, write simple statements of fact (called the *indicative mood*). Use direct commands (*imperative mood*) for procedures and instructions. Use wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions (*subjunctive mood*) sparingly. [Learn more.

  - Use
    active voice (where the subject performs the action) whenever you
    can. In passive voice, the receiver of the action is the subject. [Learn more.

  - Use second person most of the time. Second person often uses the pronoun *you,* as though you're speaking to the customer. [Learn more](/style-guide/grammar/person).
  
  - Capitalize proper nouns*—*things
    like names of unique people, places, and things (products, books,
    organizations, and companies, for example). Check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or the [A–Z word list](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25512) to find out whether a term is a proper noun. [Learn more.

  - Replace gender-specific singular pronouns (*he* or *she*) with the plural pronoun, *they,* sparingly. Write about individuals or specific roles instead. [Learn more](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25526).
  
  - Be careful with words ending in –*ing*, which can play different roles in a phrase. For example, in the phrase *meeting requirements,* make sure it’s clear whether this is a discussion about requirements for a meeting or how to meet requirements. [Learn more.

  - Prepositional phrases modify something else in a sentence. For example, in *The reading pane displays the content of the selected message,* the phrase *of the selected message* modifies *the content.* Avoid using consecutive prepositional phrases. Long chains of prepositional phrases are hard to read and interpret. **[Learn more](/style-guide/grammar/prepositions).
  
  - Modifiers
    are words or phrases that modify other words or phrases. Make sure
    it’s clear what they modify. For example, in the phrase *the selected text only is modified,* the word *only* could modify *text* or *is modified.* Rewrite as *only the selected text is modified* to clarify. [Learn more](/style-guide/grammar/dangling-misplaced-modifiers).
