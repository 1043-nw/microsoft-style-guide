# Word choice checklist

Choose simple, precise words that you use in conversations.

  - Use common contractions, such as *that's* and *don’t*. They’re friendly and conversational. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-contractions).
  - Avoid words with more than one meaning. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-simple-words-concise-sentences).
  - Use as
    few words as possible. Omit unnecessary adverbs (words that describe
    how, when, or where) and use precise, one-word verbs (such as *try* instead of *attempt to*) whenever you can. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-simple-words-concise-sentences). 
  - If you mean the same thing, use the same word. Use the [A–Z word list](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25512) and your group's editorial style guide to find preferred terms for Microsoft content.
  - Don’t give technical meanings to common words (like using *bucket* to mean *group)* or use nouns as verbs or verbs as nouns (like using *invite* instead of *invitation*). [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/dont-use-common-words-in-new-ways).

  - Don’t create
    a new word if one already exists. If you’re working on
    emerging technology, research terminology already in use before you
    create a new term. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully).

  - Use technical terms carefully and define
    them in context if there’s a chance your audience won’t understand
    them. Use plain language whenever you can. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully).
  - Use the
    words your audience uses. If you're writing for a particular
    industry, such as healthcare or construction, refer to reputable
    language sources (industry glossaries or associations, for example)
    to make sure you’re using industry terms correctly. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully). 
  - Avoid jargon when there’s a familiar word that will do. [Learn more](/style-guide/word-choice/avoid-jargon).
  - Don't
    use words that attribute human characteristics to devices and products.
    Devices don't think, feel, or otherwise exhibit human characteristics.
