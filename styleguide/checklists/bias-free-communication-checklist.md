# Bias-free communication checklist

Microsoft
technology reaches every part of the globe. Make sure all our
communications are inclusive of gender, race,
culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and
socioeconomic class.

  - Use gender-neutral or inclusive terms to refer to people. Avoid compound words containing *man* or *men*.

  - Avoid masculine pronouns. Refer to a person's role, such as *reader* or *client*, or simply use *person* or *individual*.

  - Donâ€™t use slang that could be considered derogatory or profane.

  - Don't use culturally sensitive terms, such as *demilitarized zone,* as metaphors for technology. 

  -  Use realistic examples and images that depict diverse individuals from all walks of life participating fully in activities.

  - Be careful
    with references and images related to cities, countries, and
    regions, especially disputed regions.

(This page requires Microsoft network access.)

  - Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, leisure activities, and purchasing power.

  - Avoid stereotypes in job roles. Refer to men and women of varied ethnic backgrounds across professions.

  - Focus on the person, not the disability.
