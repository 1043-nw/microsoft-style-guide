# Capitalization checklist

In general, Microsoft style is sentence-style capitalization. 

  - Always capitalize proper nouns. 
  - Lowercase everything except the first word in a sentence, UI label, phrase, heading, or title (including the titles of blogs, articles, and press releases). 
  - Don’t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.
  - Use
    title-style capitalization for product and service names, book and song
    titles, article titles in citations, names of blogs, and titles of
    people (*Vice President,* for example). 
  - It's OK to use title-style capitalization in tweets to set off a quoted article. 
  - In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms*.*
  - Don't use all uppercase for emphasis. 
  - Don't use all lowercase as a design choice.
