# Examples and scenarios

Fictitious
examples that include the names of people, places, or organizations are
potentially sensitive, both legally and from a worldwide perspective.
Use-case scenarios—detailed descriptions of specific customer
interactions with a product, service, or technology—present similar
problems. Ask your international program manager and your [group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx)
to review examples and scenarios. (This page requires Microsoft network
access.) To globalize examples and use-case scenarios, use these
guidelines.

**Use CELAWeb to obtain example content**
such as organization and personal names, addresses, phone numbers,
email addresses, currency, and URLs. You might need to include a
disclaimer noting that any similarity to real people, places, or things
is coincidental. See the following pages on CELAWeb for more
information. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)

**Be sensitive to how use-case scenarios may be perceived** in
other cultures. Social situations, politics, religion, events,
holidays, sports, traditions, and legal and business practices vary
worldwide. For example, greeting cards are uncommon in many parts
of the world, and in some cultures men and women don’t touch in public,
even to shake hands.

**Avoid mentioning real places altogether**, or use the names of recognizable cities from different parts of the world. Vary the locales from one example to the next. 

**Avoid discussing technologies and standards** that
aren't used worldwide. Standards vary, from phone, mobile, wireless,
and video to measurement, paper size, character sets, and text
direction. And don’t assume US standards are familiar or
relevant to everyone.
