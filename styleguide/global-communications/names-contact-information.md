# Names and contact information

If you’re creating a real or sample form that collects personal information, use these guidelines.

## Names

  - Use *First name* and *Last name* in forms, or simply *Full name.* 
  - If you include a *Middle name* field, make it optional. 
  - Use *Title,* not *Honorific,* to describe words such as *Mr.* and *Mrs.* Not all cultures have equivalents to some titles used in the United States, such as *Ms.*

## Addresses

  - Provide fields long enough for customers to include whatever information is appropriate for their locale. 
  - Use *State or province* instead of *State.* Fields that might not be relevant everywhere, such as S*tate or province*, should be optional. 
  - Use *Country or region* instead of just *Country* to accommodate disputed territories. It's OK to use *Country/Region* if space is limited.
  - Include a field for *Country or region code* if you need information for mailing between European countries or regions. It's OK to use *Country/Region code* if space is limited.
  - Use *Postal code* instead of *ZIP Code*. Allow for at least 10 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. 
  - Provide enough space for long phone numbers. 

## Contact information for Microsoft and third parties

  - If
    you’re providing information about how to contact
    Microsoft, remember that toll-free telephone numbers aren't
    always available worldwide. Provide an alternate way for customers
    to contact Microsoft. If appropriate, link to <http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide>.
  - Avoid
    references to third-party companies and organizations in the
    United States. In particular, avoid referring customers to US
    resources. If you must provide a vendor, supplier, or retailer
    reference, state that it’s a US company or organization, and
    suggest where customers outside the United States can
    look for local resources.
