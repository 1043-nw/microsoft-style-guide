# Names and contact information

If you’re creating a real or sample form that collects personal information, use these guidelines. And adhere to the [Privacy and security](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/home/product-development/regulatory-compliance/privacy-and-security) guidelines on CELAWeb when you collect personal information. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Many
countries strictly control what personal information
can be legally collected, stored, and shared. Before
collecting personal data outside the United States, check with
your international program manager and your [group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

## Names

  - Use *First name* and *Last name* in forms, or simply *F**ull name.* 
  - If you include a *Middle name* field, make it optional. 
  - Use *Title*, not *Honorific*, to describe words such as *Mr*. and *Mrs*. Not all cultures have equivalents to some titles used in the United States, such as *Ms*.
  - Refer to [Article 1708: Personal name formats](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/KBLibrary/1708.docx?web=1 "GPWeb KB article") on the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/Home.aspx) website for
    the correct ordering of first and last names in various cultures. The
    article also has guidelines for using the personal name formats
    available on the [Regional Formats](https://globalready.azurewebsites.net/marketreadiness/locale "GPWeb Regional Formats for personal names") page. (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

## Addresses

  - Provide fields long enough for customers to include whatever information is appropriate for their locale. 
  - Use *State or province* instead of *State*. Fields that might not be relevant everywhere, such as S*tate or province*, should be optional. 
  - Use *Country or region* instead of just *Country* to accommodate disputed territories. It's OK to use *Country/Region* if space is limited.
  - Include a field for *Country or region code* if you need information for mailing between European countries or regions. It's OK to use *Country/Region code* if space is limited.
  - Use *Postal code* instead of *ZIP Code*. Allow for at least 10 characters and a combination of letters and numbers. 
  - Provide enough space for long phone numbers. 

## Contact information for Microsoft and third parties

  - If
    you’re providing information about how to contact
    Microsoft, remember that toll-free telephone numbers aren't
    always available worldwide. Provide an alternate way for customers
    to contact Microsoft. If appropriate, link to <http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide>.
  - Avoid
    references to third-party companies and organizations in the
    United States. In particular, avoid referring customers to US
    resources. If you must provide a vendor, supplier, or retailer
    reference, state that it’s a US company or organization, and
    suggest where customers outside the United States can
    look for local resources.
