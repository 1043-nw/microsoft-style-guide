# Legal considerations

Content
is subject to the laws of the countries where it's distributed.
The laws governing product documentation, advertising,
sales promotion, and other kinds of content vary significantly
from one country or region to the next. Marketing statements and political statements are restricted by law in some countries and regions. 

Always check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) to verify that you’re complying with the laws where the content will be distributed. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

This section covers some important areas where US and international law may affect content.

## Discounts and special offers

**Include any limitations on availability** of
the offer. For each country or region where the offer is valid,
provide price information in the local currency and mention
any taxes that apply.

## Events, products, contests, and special offers
**Review the [Promotions](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Marketing/Promotions) page on CELAWeb**. All contests and sweepstakes must be approved by the [CELA Promotions team](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Marketing/Marketing-and-Advertising-Content/Promotions-Contacts). (These pages require Microsoft network access.)

**Specify where events, products, contests, and special offers are available**. Use *only*
to exclude any place not mentioned specifically. State where items
can be shipped, and note any additional charges, including
international shipping. 

**State an expiration date**, if there is one. If the offer is limited to available inventory, say so. 

**If release dates or events differ by country or region**, link to a list of release dates or provide information that can be customized based on the customer‘s location. 

**Include contact information for customers outside of the United States**, or include a link to <http://www.microsoft.com/worldwide/>.

## Standard legal language

**Include legal statements that are required in specific countries and regions**. Always check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) to verify that your legal statements comply with corporate policies and all applicable laws. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) CELA
can help you determine what you must do to comply with internet,
copyright, privacy, and business laws in various countries
and regions. 

## Privacy laws

**Understand the local laws**
regarding notification and the collection, storage, use, sharing, and
retention or destruction of personal information—before you collect
it. Adhering to the [Security and privacy](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Business-Conduct-and-Compliance/Security-and-Privacy) guidelines on CELAWeb is the surest way to comply with privacy laws worldwide. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

## Copyrights and trademarks 

**In web content, include a link to copyright and legal information**
that can be updated for specific countries or regions. If you’re
using trademarks or trademark symbols in content, follow CELA
guidance.

## Product claims

**Don’t compare one product with another**. If you must do this, send your comparisons to [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) for review, along with a description of your substantiation for the comparative claim. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) Some
countries and regions have strict requirements of documented
proof for such comparisons. Others require the permission of
the competitor. Still others restrict specific comparisons such as *more clip art than Brand* *X* (where Brand X is a named product).

**Don’t use superlatives**, such as *the world's fastest database*. It’s OK to compare your product with earlier versions of the same product, such as *our fastest version yet.*

**Ensure that third-party recommendations and
testimonials are provided willingly**. Paid endorsements
are illegal in some countries and regions. Testimonials require
permission. Always get a signed [quote permission form](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWebAuthoring/LSWDocuments/Quote_Permission_Form_Marketing.doc?d=wb65038057ef041d7b5375f9db989fd0a&Source=https%3A%2F%2Fmicrosoft%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2Fsites%2FLCAWebAuthoring%2FLSWDocuments%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx%3FInitialTabId%3DRibbon%252ERead%26VisibilityContext%3DWSSTabPersistence%23InplviewHash1adbcfb2%2D6303%2D44d4%2D8b6d%2D6e5d0d3e7dfb%3DInitialTabId%253DRibbon%25252ERead%2DVisibilityContext%253DWSSTabPersistence%2DSortField%253DModified%2DSortDir%253DDesc).

## Media ratings

**Include the media ratings**
required in the countries and regions where your product will
be distributed. For example, game software and hardware may require
an epilepsy warning in some countries and regions. Check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) if you’re not sure about the laws in countries and regions where your product will be distributed. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

## Restrictions on names of places and landmarks

**Don’t refer to countries, regions, cities, or land features that are in disputed areas** or show them on maps. Use the [PoliCheck tool](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/PoliCheck.aspx "PoliCheck term tool on the Global Readiness website") to check text for problematic names and terms. (This tool requires Microsoft network access.) Errors
in the names or boundaries of disputed territories may be
offensive or even illegal in some countries and regions. 

**Learn more** See the [](http://gpweb/marketreadiness/OfficialCountryregion)[official country/region list](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Lists/CountryRegion/CountryRegionList.aspx) on the [Global Readiness](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/Home.aspx) website.

## Legal use of third-party content

In
most cases, using photographs, artwork, videos, music, or
other content from a third party requires a specific license or
permission. Some publications require permission or payment to link
to or quote from an article. Reproducing copyrighted
content requires permission at the very least. Before
you distribute third-party content in a country or region, check
the following:

  - Make sure the third-party license includes worldwide distribution.
  - Determine whether worldwide distribution affects royalty payments.
  - Check the license expiration date, and plan to remove the content before the license expires.
  - Verify that the copyright statement protects the content anywhere it may be seen.
  - Check
    for restrictions on imported content in countries or regions where
    your product or website is likely to be seen. Maps, for
    example, are often subject to government review before they can
    be imported.
  - Before
    using clip art that’s readily available on public (or Microsoft
    internal) websites, verify that the license covers your use.

Before quoting, citing, linking to, or using copyrighted
content from third parties, check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.) When you do use third-party content, make sure you have
permission for your specific use, quote it exactly, and include the required
citations, which vary by type of content and across content sources.
