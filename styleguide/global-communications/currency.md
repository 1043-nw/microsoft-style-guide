#### Currency names

In general, lowercase the names of currencies, but capitalize the reference to the country or region. 

Examples
US dollar
Canadian dollar
Hong Kong SAR dollar
Brazilian real
South African rand
Pricing through the Microsoft Online Subscription Program is shown in US dollars.

In
a structured list, for example a table that compares available pricing
options, it's OK to capitalize the name of the currency.

#### Specific monetary amounts

When you're referencing specific amounts of money, use the currency code, followed by the amount, with no space.

Example The company generated BRL2.89 billion (USD1.42 billion) in net revenue in 2015. 

If it's clear which currency you mean, it's OK to use just the symbol. When referring to a specific amount in euros, use the euro symbol (€), not the word *euros.*

Examples
One of the largest companies in the United States, Adatum Corporation generated $1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.
Adatum Corporation generated €1.42 billion in net revenue in 2015.
