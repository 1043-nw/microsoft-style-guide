Use bigger ideas, fewer words
Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better. To learn more, see [Brand voice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361).

Example
Replace this: If you're ready to purchase Office 365 for your organization, contact your Microsoft account representative.

With this: Ready to buy? Contact us.

Write like you speak
Read
your text aloud. Does it sound like something a real person would
say? Be friendly and conversational. No. Robot. Words. To
learn more, see [Brand voice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361).

Example
Replace this: Invalid ID

With this: You need an ID that looks like this: <someone@example.com>

Project friendliness
Use contractions: *it’s, you’ll, you’re, we’re, let’s.* To learn more, see [Use contractions](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36389).

Example
Replace this: Your
Microsoft Band is not waterproof. Light rain and hand washing should
not harm it, but do not immerse your Band in liquids of any kind. Do not
wear your Band while swimming or in the shower. 

With this: Your
Microsoft Band isn't waterproof. Light rain and hand washing shouldn't
harm it, but don't immerse it in liquids or wear it while you're
swimming or in the shower.

Get to the point fast
Lead
with what’s most important. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make
customer choices and next steps obvious. To learn more, see [Scannable content](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36380).

Example
Replace this: Templates
provide a starting point for creating new documents. A template can
include the styles, formats, and page layouts you use frequently.
Consider creating a template if you often use the same page layout and
style for documents.

With this: Save
time by creating a document template that includes the styles, formats,
and page layouts you use most often. Then use the template whenever you
create a new document.

Be brief
Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word. To learn more, see [Word choice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36378).

Example
Replace this:
The Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab recommends charts that
are likely to represent your data well. Use the command when you want
to visually present data, and you're not sure how to do it. 

With this: Create a chart that's just right for your data by using the Recommend Charts command on the Insert tab.

When in doubt, don’t capitalize
Default
to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of
a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. Never Use Title
Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever. To learn more, see [Capitalization](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=33685).

Examples
Replace these: 
Find a Microsoft Partner
Office 365 Customer
Limited-Time Offer
Join Us Online

With these:
Find a Microsoft partner
Office 365 customer
Limited-time offer
Join us online

Skip periods (and : \! ?)
Skip
end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles, and
items in a list that are three or fewer words. Save the periods for
paragraphs and body copy. To learn more, see [Punctuation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25519), [Headings](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36408), and [Lists](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36412). 

Example
Replace this:
Move a tile.
1\. Press and hold the tile.

With this:
Move a tile
1\. Press and hold the tile.

Remember the last comma
In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction*.* (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma*.*) ** To learn more, see [Commas](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28752). 

Example
Replace this: Android, iOS and Windows

With this: Android, iOS, and Windows

Don’t be spacey
Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons—and no spaces around dashes. To learn more, see [Punctuation](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25519).

Example
Replace this: Use pipelines — logical groups of activities — to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

With this: Use pipelines—logical groups of activities—to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

Kill off weak writing
Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Axe *you can* and *there is, there are, there were*. To learn more, see [Verbs](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25523) and [Word choice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36378).

Example
Replace this: You can access Office apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.

With this: Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.
