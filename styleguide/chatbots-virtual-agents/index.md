# Chatbots and virtual agents

A virtual agent is a type of chatbot that can be used to:

- Provide information and answers. 
- Complete tasks like booking meetings or buying tickets.

Before you create a virtual agent, make sure it will add value to the customer experience. 

Virtual agents are good for tasks where it’s easier to ask for what you want rather than navigate through a menu 
or search for keywords. But a chatbot isn’t a human, and there are some things a virtual agent isn’t suited for. 

Technically speaking, there are two kinds of virtual agents: 

- One kind is scripted. It can respond only to questions that it was programmed to understand. 
- Another uses AI, so it can understand what the customer is telling it, and its knowledge grows the more it interacts with people.
