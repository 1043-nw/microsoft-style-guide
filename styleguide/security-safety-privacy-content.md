# Security, safety, and privacy content

Absolute
security, privacy, and safety don't exist. So when you write about
those topics (which are a big concern for many customers), be reassuring
but realistic.

Don’t make unconditional statements about security, safety, or privacy. When you write about these subjects, avoid absolute verbs, such as is, ensure, protect (without a qualifier), promise, guarantee, or secure. Instead:

  - Talk about product features, technologies, and initiatives that help customers achieve security, safety, or privacy.
    Examples
    Outlook antiphishing technology scans incoming mail automatically.
    BitLocker encryption helps to protect your data.

<!-- end list -->

  - Use qualifiers with words like safe, private, secure, and protect and their synonyms or derivatives. For example, add helps, can help, improve, and can improve.
    Examples
    Improve data security by deploying Microsoft Endpoint Protection technology.
    BitLocker helps protect data on PCs and removable drives.
    The default security settings can help protect your computer from viruses.

<!-- end list -->

  - Rewrite the text.
    Examples
    Get powerful protection with Microsoft Office 365. 
    Use location services more safely.
    Stay safer online.

Avoid images that might imply absolute security, safety, or privacy, such as padlocks, fortresses, vaults, and safes. 

Know your audience. A teenager and an IT pro have different knowledge of security technologies and tolerance for risk. Write accordingly.
