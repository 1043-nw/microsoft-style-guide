Screenshots
are useful for simplifying complex procedures or concepts. But use
them sparingly. If they contain text, and most do, localizing them
is expensive and time-consuming. 

When you use screenshots, follow these guidelines.

  - Show only the portion of the screen that's necessary to explain the concept or procedure.
    Example

  - Create text in the interface that reflects Microsoft voice and editorial style.
  - Use approved fictitious names and scenarios. To learn more, see [Fictitious names, domains, and addresses](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26697).
  - Describe
    the image clearly and completely in captions or alt text to
    support people with low vision. To learn more about accessible
    images, see [Graphics, design, and media](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=32191).
  - If
    the screenshot will be localized, give your localization team or vendor
    the files shown in the image, in addition to detailed
    instructions on how to re-create the screenshot.
