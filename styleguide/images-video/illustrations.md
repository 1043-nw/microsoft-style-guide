Follow [Microsoft brand illustration guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Illustration.aspx) if you’re using illustrations in your content. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Tell an engaging story. Illustration
should have a purpose beyond decoration. Use it to communicate a
clear message in a visually engaging way.

Stylize with active geometry. Microsoft illustration style utilizes geometric shapes that feel digital and align with our product user experiences. Illustration should be simple, but never static or sterile.

Use vivid color. Use energetic, flat colors drawn from the [Microsoft color palette](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Color.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Use the Microsoft illustration library. Avoid purchasing stock illustration whenever possible. [Find a Microsoft illustration.](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/Bundles/Illustrations_Editable_AllCollections.aspx) (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Make sure you have legal permission to use the illustrations in your content. To learn about legal guidelines for using images, see [Copyrights and trademarks](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26696).

Avoid using text in illustrations that
will be localized. If you must use text, put it on a separate
layer from the graphics. To learn more about using images in global
communications, see [Art](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26910).

If illustrations convey information that’s
important to the story, describe them clearly and completely in
captions or alt text to support people with low vision. To learn
more about accessible images, see [Graphics, design, and media](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=32191).
