# Video

Done
well, video often communicates faster and more clearly than text and
static images. But video usually takes longer and costs more to
produce, requires more bandwidth to view, can be expensive to
localize, and may not meet your accessibility goals. Balance the
tradeoffs, and do what’s best for your customers and your business
goals.

Follow these guidelines:

  - Keep
    videos short—under 90 seconds when you can. For more complex
    subjects, consider creating several short segments and
    combining them in a playlist.
  - Write video titles that describe the content clearly. Include the video length. 
  - Lead
    with what’s most important. Make your key points clear and
    memorable. Get to them quickly, without lengthy introductions, and
    stick to them. Don't include extraneous detail or try to
    communicate more than the viewer can take in.
  - Tell
    a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Simple narratives
    are best. Start by telling viewers what they'll learn. End with a
    call to action to try it themselves.
  - Use the same voice principles that you use in other content. For more information, see [Brand voice](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28361). 
  - Maintain
    a consistent pace and ratio of audio to video. Don't talk too fast
    or too slowly. Practice timing your actions with your words.
  - Speak and enunciate clearly. 
  - Don’t
    be afraid to be silent while you complete the actions, and don’t
    worry about explaining every action. Visual images can communicate
    simple, common actions, such as selecting OK.
  - Don’t
    refer back to earlier parts of the video unless
    it’s necessary. If you must refer to earlier parts of the video,
    keep it general. 

Example
Earlier, you saw how to add *x* to *z.* Here's something else you can do with *x* ....*
*

  - Include
    captions for accessibility. If possible, break closed-captioning
    into short, one-sentence chunks, so they're easier to read.
  - Avoid
    mentioning dates and product versions or showing images that will
    date your content. This will keep your video relevant longer.
  - Close a video with a URL where the viewer can learn more.
  - Use brand elements and colors for opening and closing frames. The easiest way to do that is to use the [Microsoft end-card](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/Bundles/Microsoft_logo_endcard_animation.aspx)[animation and guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/Bundles/Microsoft_logo_endcard_animation.aspx).
