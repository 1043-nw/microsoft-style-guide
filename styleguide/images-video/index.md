# Images and video

Pictures
can bring stories to life, simplify complex content, and replace
a lot of words. Use images and video when they help you convey
information or supplement the story. Most websites, templates, and
publishing platforms have guidelines for using images and video.
Start there. This section will help you choose or create the right
images for your message:

  - [Photos](/style-guide/images-video/photos)
  - [Illustrations](/style-guide/images-video/illustrations)
  - [Screenshots](/style-guide/images-video/screenshots)
  - [Network traffic flows](/style-guide/images-video/network-traffic-flows)
  - [Video](/style-guide/images-video/video)

Before using images in your content, familiarize yourself with the following guidelines:
