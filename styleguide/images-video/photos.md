# Photos

Microsoft photos are authentic, optimistic, and brave.

  - **Authentic** You believe it and feel like you’re there.
  - **Optimistic** We illuminate the joy and triumph of everyday life.
  - **Brave** We aren’t afraid to stand out and be ourselves.

When you need photos to illustrate web content, brochures, or marketing collateral, use the [Microsoft photo library](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Search/pages/BCPhotographyResults.aspx), an expansive set of shared lifestyle and product photography available for use in Microsoft communications. (This site requires Microsoft network access.) Avoid purchasing stock photography if you can. 

To learn more about images and the Microsoft brand, see the [Microsoft brand photography guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Photography.aspx "Photography guidelines on Brand Central").

Sometimes content calls for images of people, places, and events. When creating and choosing images:

  - Look for images that tell a story.
  - Avoid clichéd scenarios and staged interactions, which often don’t look believable. 
  - Avoid idle or static subjects. Look for photos that show action or genuine interaction. 
  - Avoid posed photos or photos that show fake emotion. 
  - Look for photos with rich color. 
  - Avoid contrived or unrealistic settings. 
  - Avoid photos that are biased toward western culture. To learn more, see [Bias-free communication](/style-guide/bias-free-communication).

**Crop images**, if necessary,
to eliminate unnecessary detail. If text will overlay an image,
make sure it won’t cover any important details. The guidelines for
your website, template, or platform may include guidance
for placing text over images. 

**Make sure you have legal permission** to use the photos in your content. To learn about legal guidelines for using images, see [Copyrights and trademarks](/style-guide/legal-content/copyrights-trademarks).

**Never incorporate text** as
part of an image file—images are difficult and expensive to
localize. To learn more about using images in global communications,
see [Art](/style-guide/global-communications/art).

**If images convey information**
that’s important to the story, describe them clearly and
completely in captions or alt text to support people with low
vision. To learn about accessible images, see [Graphics, design, and media](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26700).
