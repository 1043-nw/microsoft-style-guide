# Cortana

Cortana is a type of bot that responds to requests and questions submitted in the customer’s own words to complete tasks 
on the customer’s behalf. This type of bot uses AI to “learn” so that interactions become more helpful and relevant over time.

When you need to describe Cortana, use *personal digital assistant,* not *agent, virtual assistant,* or *intelligent personal assistant.*

Outside Cortana, Microsoft isn’t creating any new bot personas or personalities in the personal digital assistant category.
