# General guidelines

**Make the customer experience better**

Before you create a virtual agent, make sure it will add value to the customer experience. 

Virtual agents are good for tasks where it’s easier to ask for what you want rather than navigate through a menu or search for keywords. 
But a chatbot isn’t a human, and there are some things a virtual agent isn’t suited for. 

**Don’t create a chatbot with a name and human persona**

Your chatbot shouldn’t have a person’s name and human characteristics. Zo, Xiaoice, and Rinna are the only “personified” chatbots 
Microsoft has, and we’re not creating any more. 

Your chatbot might not need a name if it’s integrated into a product. If it’s standalone, give it a name that describes what it is 
and does and conveys that it’s not a real person.
