# Social chatbots

Social chatbots, also called relationship chatbots, provide people a way to chat with a digital persona to have fun and interact socially. 

Social chatbots have a human persona and use AI to “learn” so that interactions become more relevant and meaningful over time. 

Microsoft has three social chatbots: Zo, Xiaoice, and Rinna. Don’t create any new personas or personalities in this category.
