# Content planning

Great content starts with a plan that begins with these questions.

**Who is your audience?** This could
be broad—developers, for example—but defining your audience more
specifically will help you refine your plan. Is your audience
writing software? Apps? IT tools? Games? Are they hobbyists,
full-time developers, or IT pros who write code? What development
software do they use?

**What do they want to accomplish?** Are
they deciding whether to buy your product? Setting up a new computer?
Learning new software? Preparing for a migration? Struggling with a
PivotTable? Planning for network security? Is their need urgent?
Few customers come to us to see what’s new. Understanding why they
come will help you satisfy their needs.

**What is your business goal for providing the content?** 
Are you building enthusiasm for an upcoming product launch?
Establishing a competitive position in the marketplace?
Documenting an out-of-band release? Providing support content to
accelerate migration? Although the customer’s goals are paramount,
every communication has a business reason, too.

**Do you have time or budget constraints?** If
time is of the essence, content you can create quickly might be
best. The budget and the availability of an agency
or specialized resources, like illustrators, designers, and video producers, will help you determine what content options are realistic.

**What kind of content best meets the customer's needs and business goals?** If
the concepts are hard to explain, video or infographics could be
just the thing. If the customer is preparing for a major project,
maybe they need checklists and sample project plans, or a pricing
calculator. For breaking news, tweets or a strategic blog post
might be the best approach. 

**How will the customer find the content?** 
What search terms will the customer use? Plan for search
keyword optimization; links back to your content; and promotion through
home pages, blogs, newsletters, events, third-party sites,
communities, and social media if appropriate. To learn more, see [Search and writing](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=36379). 

**Where will the customer look for information?** 
Part of knowing your customers is understanding where they go for
information. If they have a problem, they may look to product
documentation, Microsoft support, or an expert community. For
training, Microsoft Virtual Academy or a video platform like
YouTube might be their source. For tips and tricks, maybe it’s
social media and blogs.

**What devices will the customer use to experience the content? Laptops** ?
Tablets? Phones? Wearable devices? Entertainment consoles? All of
those? Plan for a great experience across devices the customer is
likely to use. 

**Will the content be translated or localized?** 
If so, plan your content to streamline those processes and contain
costs. To learn more about developing content for translation and
localization, see [Global communications](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26906).

**How will you measure success?** Do
you have numeric targets for views, clicks, or downloads? Goals for
mentions or backlinks? Targets for lead generation? Planning for
specific objectives up front will help you create content that
meets them.

With these questions answered, you can narrow your approach. For example:

  - If the customer need is immediate, maybe you blog today and create a more polished article later. 
  - If budget and timeline are tight, you might choose a simple text format. 
  - If the audience is large and the topic complex, a short, professionally produced video might make sense.
  - If
    content will be localized in multiple languages, graphics
    supported by text might meet the customer and business need at a
    lower cost.
