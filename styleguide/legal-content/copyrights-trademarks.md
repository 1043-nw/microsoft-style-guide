Copyrights
and trademark registration protect intellectual property. This
section summarizes things you can do to help. For the full story,
see [Protecting our content](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Copyrights/Protecting-Copyrights) on CELAWeb. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) If you have a question, contact [your group’s paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx).

#### Microsoft copyrights

Webpages on Microsoft.com
include a standard footer that covers copyright and other legal
requirements for Microsoft websites. You don’t need to do anything else
to protect Microsoft materials published on Microsoft.com sites. The standard footer is available through the [Universal Header and Footer Service](https://uhfportal-test.azurewebsites.net/). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Marketing materials and press releases
don't require copyright notices. Marketing materials include
any communication designed to influence a purchase decision. 

Most other downloadable or printed content requires a copyright notice. Follow the [](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Copyrights/Legal-Notices)[CELA guidelines for creating copyright notices](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Copyrights/Legal-Notices).

#### Third-party copyrights

In
the social media world we live in, you probably see bits of copy,
images, and other content lifted from the internet, with or
without credit given, every day. Some of these uses probably
violate copyrights. 

In
most cases, using photographs, artwork, videos, music, or
other content from a third party requires a specific license or
permission. Some publications require permission or payment to link
to or quote from an article. Reproducing copyrighted content
always requires permission at the very least.

Before
using an illustration, photo, video, song, or other audio or
video content, license all necessary rights, including rights
to publish in other countries if necessary. Even if a Microsoft
employee took a photo, you need permission to use it. To learn more
about image and media rights, see [Using photos, videos, or other media in advertising](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Marketing/Marketing-and-Advertising-Content/Photos-and-Other-Media). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Before quoting, citing, linking to, or using copyrighted content from third parties, check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.) When
you use third-party content, make sure you quote it exactly
and include the required citations, which vary for types of content
and across content sources.

#### Microsoft trademarks

Your
actions as a writer help protect Microsoft
trademarks. Trademark guidelines vary depending on the
type of content you create and the product or service you're writing
about. In general:

  - Include *Microsoft* the first time you mention a product or service name in body text. 
    Exceptions 
    When you list several product names, include *Microsoft* before the first name only.
    Always include *Microsoft* in the names Microsoft Office, Microsoft Press, and Microsoft Dynamics.
    Never include *Microsoft* before *Xbox* and *Windows.*
    Product naming guidelines can change. For information about how to refer to a specific name, see the applicable [group editorial style guide](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/StyleGuide/List).
  - Don’t create abbreviations or acronyms out of trademarks (or any product or service name).
  - Don’t use possessive, plural, or verb forms of Microsoft trademarks.
  - Set logos apart with white space around them. Don’t use them as design elements or alter them in any way. For more information, see the [logo guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Pages/The-Microsoft-brand-Core-elements-Logo.aspx) on Brand Central. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
  - Use approved product and service names and branding, even if the name isn’t trademarked.

Webpages on Microsoft.com include
a standard footer that covers trademark notices and other legal
requirements for Microsoft websites. You don’t need to do anything else
to protect Microsoft trademarks used on Microsoft.com sites. The standard footer is available through the [Universal Header and Footer Service](https://uhfportal-test.azurewebsites.net/). (This site requires Microsoft network access.)

Products, product packaging, books, and product documentation CELA maintains specific trademark requirements for these items. See [Trademark list and attribution requirements](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Trademark-List-and-Usage) for more information. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

#### Third-party trademarks 

Before using content that includes third-party logos, check with the [trademark legal contact](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Contacts) for your group. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

Include
trademark symbols and a footnote for third-party trademarks only when a
contract with the company requires it, typically as part of a license
agreement. Each business group maintains its own agreements. Work with
your internal partners—often product managers—and [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) to comply with contractual requirements regarding third-party trademarks. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
