# Accessibility guidelines and requirements

Microsoft
devices and services empower people around the globe—at home, at work,
and on the go—to do the activities they value most. Our technology
empowers people of all abilities. Accessible content and user experiences meet the [Microsoft Accessibility Standards (MAS)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/msenable/Pages/AccessibilityStandard.aspx) requirements,
which cover software and hardware development, web content, and other
forms of content like audio, video, animations, images, and interactive.
(The Microsoft Accessibility Standards site requires Microsoft network access.)

This section provides an overview of accessibility guidelines:
