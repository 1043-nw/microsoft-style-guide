Choose
colors and patterns carefully. High contrast may improve
readability for people who have low vision. For people with some types
of color blindness, certain color combinations are difficult to
distinguish. 

**Don’t convey information with color alone.** 
For example, use both color and underlined text for links, and use
pattern and color to differentiate information in charts
and graphs. Remember that high-contrast personalization themes
in Windows alter text color. 

**Don’t hard-code colors. They can become illegible in high-contrast themes.**

**Don’t use low-contrast or hard-to-read color combinations, such as light green and white or red and green.**

**Don’t use screens or tints in art.**

**Don’t use screened or shaded backgrounds, watermarks, or other images behind text. Reduced contrast makes text harder to read and hinders screen readers.**
