Punctuation
provides vital clues for reader understanding. It's governed by
well-documented rules. For example, every English sentence
requires end punctuation (unless it's a title or a heading). Within
those rules are stylistic choices, which we’ll cover here. 

Writing tip The more
punctuation you add, the more complex a sentence becomes. If a
sentence contains more than a comma or two and ending punctuation,
consider rewriting it to make it crisp and clear.
