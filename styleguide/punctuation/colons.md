#### Preceding lists

Include a colon at the end of a phrase that directly introduces a list.

Example
We can create a backup of all sorts of things to make the transition easier, including: 

  - The apps you've installed on your phone, along with high scores and progress from participating apps. 
  - The passwords for your accounts. 
  - Your call history.

Within sentences

Use colons sparingly at the end of a statement followed by a second statement that expands on it. 

Example Microsoft
ActiveSync doesn’t recognize this device for one of two reasons:
the device wasn't connected properly or the device isn't a
smartphone.

Most of the time, two sentences are more readable.

When you use a colon in a sentence, lowercase the word that follows it unless:

  - The colon introduces a direct quotation.
    Example What does it mean when I see a message that asks: "Are you trying to visit this site?"
  - The first word after the colon is a proper noun.
    Example We're considering three cities for the event: Los Angeles, Munich, and Tokyo.
