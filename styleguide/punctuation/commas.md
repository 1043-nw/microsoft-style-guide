# Commas

## Use a comma:

  - In
    a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction.
    (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or
    serial comma.)  
    
    **Examples**  
    Outlook includes Mail, Calendar, People, and Tasks.  
    Save your file to a hard drive, an external drive, or OneDrive.

    **Writing tip** If a series contains more than three items or the items are long, consider a bulleted list to improve readability.

  - Following an introductory phrase. 

    **Example** With the Skype app, you can call any phone.

  - To join independent clauses with a conjunction, such as *and, or, but,* or *so.*

    **Example** Select **Options**, and then select **Enable fast saves**.

    **Writing tip** If the sentence is long or complex, consider rewriting as two sentences.

  - To surround the year when you use a complete date within a sentence.

    **Example** See the product reviews in the February 4, 2015, issue of the *New York Times.*

## Don’t use a comma:

  - To join independent clauses when you don't use a conjunction. (Use a semicolon instead.)

    **Example** Select Options; then select Enable fast saves.

  - Between verbs in a compound predicate (when two verbs apply to a single subject).

    **Example** The program evaluates your computer system and then copies the essential files to the target location. 

    **Writing tip** Consider replacing a compound predicate with two sentences. Or add a subject for the second verb.

    **Examples**  
    The program evaluates your computer system. Then it copies the essential files to the target location.  
    The program evaluates your computer system, and then it copies the essential files to the target location. 

  - Between the month and the year when a specific date isn’t mentioned.
