# Slashes

When necessary, differentiate between a *slash* for URLs and a *backslash* for servers and folders.

When you instruct customers to enter a slash, always include the spelled-out term (*backslash* or *forward slash*) first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.<br />**Example** Enter two backslashes (\\\\) ....

Use a slash:

  - To imply a combination. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. For example, if *country/region* is used as a label in a form, capitalize it as *Country/Region.*<br /><br />**Examples**<br />client/server<br />TCP/IP<br />CD/DVD drive<br />Use the on/off switch to turn your mouse off when you're not using it.<br />Select the On/Off toggle.

  - To separate parts of an internet address. Use two slashes after the protocol name. <br /><br />**Example** ftp://example.com/downloads

  - In server, folder, and file names. <br /><br />**Example** \\\\mslibrary\\catalog\\collect.doc

  - Between the numerator and denominator of fractions in equations that occur in text.<br /><br />**Examples**<br />a/x + b/y = 1<br />x + 2/3(y) = m

Donâ€™t use a slash as a substitute for *or,* like *product/**service.* If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use *or* to describe the action in text.

**Examples**<br />Select Automatic trapping to add or remove a check mark.<br />To turn the purchasing workflow on or off ....

**Exception** It's OK to use *country/region* and *ZIP Code/postal code* where space is limited.
