# Dashes and hyphens

Dashes and hyphens aren’t interchangeable. Follow these guidelines to help you use them the right way, in the right places.

  - [Hyphens](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens.md). Use to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Don’t use two hyphens in place of an em dash.  
  
  - [Em dashes](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/emes.md). Use to set off or emphasize parenthetical phrases.  
  
  - [En dashes](~/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/enes.md).
    Use in ranges of numbers and dates, in negative numbers, and as a minus
    sign. Use to connect compound modifiers under specific conditions.
