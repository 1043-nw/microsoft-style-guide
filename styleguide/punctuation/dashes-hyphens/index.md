# Dashes and hyphens

Dashes and hyphens aren’t interchangeable. Follow these guidelines to help you use them the right way, in the right places.

  - [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens). Use to join words and connect prefixes to stem words. Don’t use two hyphens in place of an em dash.
  - [Em dashes](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/emes). Use to set off or emphasize parenthetical phrases.
  - [En dashes](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/enes).
    Use in ranges of numbers and dates, in negative numbers, and as a minus
    sign. Use to connect compound modifiers under specific conditions.
