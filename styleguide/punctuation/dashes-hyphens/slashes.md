When necessary, differentiate between a *slash* for URLs and a *backslash* for servers and folders.

When you instruct customers to enter a slash, always include the spelled-out term (*backslash *or *forward slash*) first, followed by the symbol in parentheses.
Example Enter two backslashes (\\\\) ....

Use a slash:

  - To imply a combination. Capitalize the word after the slash if the word before the slash is capitalized. For example, if *country/region* is used as a label in a form, capitalize it as *Country/Region.*

Examples
client/server
TCP/IP
CD/DVD drive
Use the on/off switch to turn your mouse off when you're not using it.
Select the On/Off toggle.

  - To separate parts of an internet address. Use two slashes after the protocol name. 

Example ftp://example.com/downloads

  - In server, folder, and file names. 

Example \\\\mslibrary\\catalog\\collect.doc

  - Between the numerator and denominator of fractions in equations that occur in text.

Examples
a/x + b/y = 1
x + 2/3(y) = m

Donâ€™t use a slash as a substitute for *or, *like *product/**service.* If the UI uses a slash in this way, follow the interface in describing the label, but use *or *to describe the action in text.

Examples
Select Automatic trapping to add or remove a check mark.
To turn the purchasing workflow on or off ....

Exception It's OK to use *country/region* and *ZIP Code/postal code* where space is limited.
