Sidebars are
useful in longer articles or documents to call out interesting
sections and break up long spans of text. The content you put in a
sidebar should be fairly short, interesting, and related but not
crucial to the article. 

Typically
people read sidebars before or after the rest of the page, so donâ€™t use
sidebars for information that should be read in sequence with the
main text.
