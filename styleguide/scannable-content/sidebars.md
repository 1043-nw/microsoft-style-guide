Sidebars are
useful in longer articles or documents to call out interesting
sections and break up long spans of text. The content you put in a
sidebar should be fairly short, interesting, and related but not
crucial to the article. 

Typically
people read sidebars before or after the rest of the page, so don’t use
sidebars for information that should be read in sequence with the
main text.
