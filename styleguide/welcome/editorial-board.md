# Microsoft Editorial Board

Microsoft-wide
questions of style are managed by the Microsoft Editorial Board, which
represents products, organizations, channels, roles, and lines of
business across the company. The Editorial Board works closely with the [Microsoft Brand Studio](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/ "Brand Central portal") to align editorial style and voice across everything we do. (The Brand Central site requires Microsoft network access.)
