# How to use this guide

1.  Review the list of [Microsoft style references](/style-guide/welcome/style-references). Always use your product group's editorial style guide first, and then this all-Microsoft guide.
2.  Check out the [Top 10 tips for Microsoft style and voice](/style-guide/top-10-tips-style-voice) to learn 10 simple guidelines that will make a big difference in your writing.
3.  Review the [Checklists](/style-guide/checklists/checklists "Quick how-to's") section. If
    you need more information, head for the full topic in the related
    section. If you're new to Microsoft or new to writing for Microsoft,
    this is a great place to start. Skimming through the checklists, you'll
    quickly figure out what you already know and start filling in the
    gaps for what you don't. It's also easy to download the entire guide as a
    Word document by selecting **Download style guide.
