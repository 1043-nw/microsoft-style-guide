# author

Don't use as a verb to mean *write*.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to refer to *authoring tools* or *authoring environments* and to use *author* to refer to *authoring* in language-specific or tool-specific contexts. For example, it's OK to say *authoring in XML*. 

In content for a general audience, use *write* instead.
