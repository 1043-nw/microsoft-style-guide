The Microsoft technologies that customers use to get things done come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Always refer to your group's editorial style guide for details about when to use *app, application, product,* and *service.*

If possible, refer to a product by its descriptor, such as *database management system* or *spreadsheet.*

Most of the time use app, not application, to describe desktop apps and cloud apps for tablets and mobile devices. 

Global tip The abbreviated form, *app,* isn't available in all languages, so allow enough space for the full translated term in localized content.

For full-featured products, such as Office and Visual Studio, it's OK to use program instead of application.

It's OK to use application in
content for a technical audience, especially to refer to a set of
software files that includes executable files and other components.

Don't use application program.
