# app, application

The Microsoft technologies that customers use to get things done come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Always refer to your group's editorial style guide for details about when to use *app*, *application*, *product*, and *service*.

If possible, refer to a product by its descriptor, such as *database management system* or *spreadsheet*.

Most of the time use _app_, not _application_, to describe desktop apps and cloud apps for tablets and mobile devices. 

**Global tip** The abbreviated form, *app*, isn't available in all languages, so allow enough space for the full translated term in localized content.

For full-featured products, such as Office and Visual Studio, it's OK to use _program_ instead of _application_.

It's OK to use _application_ in
content for a technical audience, especially to refer to a set of
software files that includes executable files and other components.

Don't use _application program_.
