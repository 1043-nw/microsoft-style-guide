[Don't use ]*[&]*[ in place of *and* in text or headings ][unless you're referring to the use of the symbol in UI.]

[It's OK to use ]*[&]*[ in content for technical audiences that covers its use in HTML or programming languages.  ]

[Example][
To ][display a reserved character in HTML, use a character reference, which consists of an ampersand, the code name or number of the character, and a semicolon. For example, use ]*[&lt;]*[ or ]*[&\#60;]*[ to display the less than sign (&lt;), and use ]*[&gt; ]*[or ]*[&\#62;]*[ to display the greater than sign (&gt;).]
