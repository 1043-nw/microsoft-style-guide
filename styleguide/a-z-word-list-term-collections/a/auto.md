# auto-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *auto-*, such as *autoscale* and *autodial*, unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or refer to your group's editorial style guide.

Don’t create new words beginning with *auto-.*

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens).

For more information about prefixes, see [*The Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). If you have Microsoft network access, you can use [*The Chicago Manual of Style Online*](http://aka.ms/mslibrary/cms) through MS Library.
