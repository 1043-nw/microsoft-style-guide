# and so on

In general, don't use *and so on* except where screen space is limited. Instead, be specific.

**Example**  
Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and other serif fonts. (Not *Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)

Don't use *and so on* to end a phrase that begins with *for example* or *such as*. It's redundant.

**Example**  
Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman and Palatino. (Not *Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)

**Exception**  
It's OK to use *and so on* to indicate a logical progression where at least two items have been named.

**Example** a, b, c, and so on
