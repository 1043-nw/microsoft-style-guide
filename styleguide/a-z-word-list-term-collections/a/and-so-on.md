[In general, don't use ]*[and so on]*[ except where screen space is limited. Instead, be specific.]

][Body text is most ][readable][ in Times New Roman, Palatino, and other serif fonts. (Not ][*Body text is most readable in Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)]

[Don't use ]*[and so on]*[ to end a phrase that begins with ]*[for example]*[ or ]*[such as]*[. It's redundant.]

[Example][
][Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman and Palatino. (Not ][*Body text is most readable in serif fonts, such as Times New Roman, Palatino, and so on.*)]

[Exception]  [
][It's OK to use ]*[and so on]*[ to indicate a logical progression where at least two items have been named.]

[Example][ a, b, c, and so on]
