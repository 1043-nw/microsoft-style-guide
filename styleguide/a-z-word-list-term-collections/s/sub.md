In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *sub-*, such as *subheading* and *subsection*, unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion or if *sub-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *sub-Saharan*. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or consult your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28765).
