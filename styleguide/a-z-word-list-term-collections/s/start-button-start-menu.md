Capitalize references to the Start menu and the Start button on the Windows taskbar. Use bold formatting for *Start* when you're referring to the menu or button.

Don’t refer to the Start button as the *Windows Start button*.

Don't include the word *button *unless it's necessary for clarity. If you do, *button *is lowercase.

If possible, to help customers locate the button, include the Start graphic ![](start-button-start-menu_files/967781121.png) in references to the Start button. 

On Windows phone, use *Start*, not *Start screen* or *Home screen,* to describe the initial screen. Don't use bold formatting for *Start* when discussing Windows phones.

Examples
