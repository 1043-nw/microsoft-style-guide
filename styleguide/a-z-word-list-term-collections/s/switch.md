# switch

As a verb, use instead of *activate* or *toggle*.

**Example** Use Alt+Tab to switch between open windows.

In content for a technical audience, it's OK to use *switch* as a noun to refer to command-line and compiler options, such as **/Za**. Because some groups use *option* instead, refer to your group's editorial style guide.
