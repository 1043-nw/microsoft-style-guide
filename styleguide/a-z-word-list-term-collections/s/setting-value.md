Avoid generic nouns, such as *setting* or *value,* in content for a general audience. Use a specific noun, such as *width, color,* or *font*, instead.

Examples
Select a color for an appointment or a meeting. 
Enter a location for Tab stop position.

It's OK to use *settings* or *values* occasionally when you need to talk generally about more than one. Don't use *attributes* or *properties* as a synonym.
