Use *sorry* only in error messages that result in serious problems for the customer. These include:

  - Data is lost.
  - The customer can't continue to use the device, service, or application.
  - The customer must get help from a support representative.
  - A product or service fails. 

Don't
apologize for inconveniences that result from normal functioning,
such as waiting for a network connection to be found. Consider *Oops* or *Hmm* instead.

Examples
We're sorry, but we detected a problem and your PC was shut down to protect your files and other data.
Sorry, the service isn't available right now.
This task couldn't be completed. Please try again.
Hmm ... looks like that link is broken.
Oops ... this page didn't load properly.
Let's try this again.

Use the [A–Z word list](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=25512) and your group's editorial style guide to find preferred terms.
