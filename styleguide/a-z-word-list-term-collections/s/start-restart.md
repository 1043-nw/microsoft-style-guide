# start, restart

Don't use *start* or *launch* to describe selecting a program or app from the **Start** menu to open it. Use *open* instead. 

Use *restart* to describe closing and reopening a program or app or turning a device off and then immediately back on. 

**See also** [Describing interactions with UI](~/procedures-instructions/describing-interactions-with-ui.md), [turn on, turn off](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/t/turn-on-turn-off.md)
