In general, avoid talking about UI elements. Most of the time, just describe what the customer needs to do.

In content for a general audience, it's OK to use *slider* when
you need to describe the UI element used to set a value on a continuous
range of possible values, such as screen brightness, mouse-click speed,
or volume.

In content for developers, it's OK to refer to a slider as a *trackbar control*.

Don't refer to the scroll box or a progress indicator as a slider.

Example
Move the slider downward to decrease the volume.
