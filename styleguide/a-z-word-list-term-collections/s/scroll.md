Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as *move through* instead, if the context is clear.

It's OK to use *scroll*
in content that teaches beginning skills to describe
interacting with a document by using a mouse,
keyboard, or other peripheral device.

Examples
Move through the folder until you see the file you want.
Move the the wheel button on the Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse to scroll up and down in a document.
