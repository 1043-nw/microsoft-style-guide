Two words.

Most of the time, avoid talking about specific UI elements. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. 

When you need to refer to a group box for a general audience, don't include the words *group box*. Just refer to the name of the group box. 

Example Under Effects, select Hidden.

It's OK to use *group box* in content for a technical audience.
