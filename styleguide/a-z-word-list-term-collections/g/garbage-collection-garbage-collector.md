# garbage collection, garbage collector

OK to use in content for a technical audience to refer
to the automatic recovery of heap memory or to the automatic
deletion of objects that the runtime environment determines are no
longer being used. 

Use *garbage collector* to describe the component of a runtime environment that performs garbage collection.
