[Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take. ]

[Don’t use *gray* or *grayed out* to describe commands or options that are in an unusable state—use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead. Use *appears dimmed* if you must describe their appearance. Use *shaded* to describe the appearance of check boxes that represent a mixture of settings.]

[Examples][
][The command isn’t available until you select text.
][If the option ][appears dimmed, it's not available.
][[Selected effects appear shaded. ]]
