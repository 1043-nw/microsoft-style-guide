Lowercase. 

Plural: *euros* 

Symbol: €

HTML code: *&\#128; *(Alt+0128 on the numeric keypad) 

In
US content, place the euro symbol in front of the amount. Different
locales might place the euro symbol elsewhere, as appropriate. A euro is divided into 100 *cents*. When
expressing an amount in euros and cents in US content, use a decimal
point. Different locales might use a decimal point or a comma, as
appropriate.

Example €3.50

Use *supports the euro currency standard *to refer to a country's use of the euro.

Use the following phrases to refer to countries that have adopted the euro as their currency:

  - European Union (EU) members trading in euros 
  - European Union (EU) members that have adopted the euro 
  - euro nations 
  - members of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) 

Use references to the EMU cautiously. Some people aren't familiar with the organization.

Note On subsequent mentions, it's OK to use the abbreviations *EU* and *EMU.* It's also OK to refer to EU members as *EU member states* and to EMU members as *EMU member states.*

Use *non-euro nations* to refer to EU member states that haven't adopted the euro as their currency.

The terms *euroland* and *eurozone*
are OK to use on websites with an informal tone. Don't use these
terms in product documentation or other formal contexts, especially if
the content will be localized.
