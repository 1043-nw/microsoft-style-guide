Don't create new words with *e-* (for *electronic*). 

It's OK to use e-words, such as *e-book* and *e-commerce,* that are included in this guide, in your group's editorial style guide, and in [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/). 

Almost all e-words are hyphenated. *Email* is an exception.

Lowercase the *e* in body text, and capitalize the *E* at the beginning of a sentence or
a heading. The letter following the hyphen is capitalized
only when title-style capitalization is required, which is
rare in Microsoft content. 

Examples
(Sentence-style capitalization) E-commerce and security
(Title-style capitalization) Strategic E-Commerce Systems and Tools for Competing in the Digital Marketplace
