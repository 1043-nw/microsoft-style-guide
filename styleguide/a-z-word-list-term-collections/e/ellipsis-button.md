The
name of the ellipsis button varies, based on the result of using it.
Consult your group's editorial style sheet to find out what to call
it.

On
the first mention, provide a graphic of the button or include (…) after
the button name. On subsequent mentions, use the graphic rather than
the words. 

Don't capitalize *ellipsis* when used as a button name. 

If your group's editorial style sheet refers to the ellipsis button as *More*, capitalize *More* and include the ellipsis in parentheses.
