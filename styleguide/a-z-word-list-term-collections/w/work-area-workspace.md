*Work area* is two words. *Workspace* is one word.

In general, don't discuss UI. Instead, talk about what the customer wants to do.

If it's necessary to describe UI, use *workspace* to refer to the area within a window where the customer interacts with the UI.

Use *work area* only when the term has a specific meaning in a particular product.
