Use *web services* to refer to protocols and data formats, like XML, SOAP, and WSDL, that provide the means for integrating web-based apps. 

Donâ€™t use *web service* or *web services* to refer generally to apps and services that you access online. Instead, mention the service by name or use *service* or *services* instead.
