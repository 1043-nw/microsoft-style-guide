Consult [your group’s paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) before using this term. In many cases, *licensed* and *unlicensed* may be better term choices. 

In general, use only in specific situations, such as:

  - In software, notices about making illegal copies*.*
  - In local content, actions that may violate local laws.
  - In reference to the violation of international law. 

Don't use to mean *invalid* or *not valid*.
