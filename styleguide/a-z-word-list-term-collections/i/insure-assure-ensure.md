*Ensure**,* *insure,* and *assure* are interchangeable in many situations. To improve worldwide readability, Microsoft style makes these distinctions:

  - Use *ensure* to mean *to make sure* or *to guarantee*. 
  - Use *insure* to mean *to provide insurance*. 
  - Use *assure* to mean *to state positively* or *to make confident*.
