[Use only to describe a graphic representation of an object that a customer can select and open, such as a drive, folder, document, or app.]

[Don't use ]*[icon]*[ to describe graphical dialog box options or options that appear on ribbons, toolbars, toolboxes, or other areas of a window. For options that have graphics rather than text labels, ][use the most descriptive term available, such as ]*[button]*[, ]*[box]*[, or ]*[check box]*[. To refer to the graphic itself, if there's no other identifying label, use ]*[symbol]*[, as in *warning symbol.*]

[[Don't use *icon* to refer to the buttons (Back, Start, Search, Volume, Power) on Windows phone.]]

[When referring to an icon, use bold formatting for the icon name. ][[In instructions, use the name of the icon and its image, but don't use the word *icon*.]]
[[
]][Example][
][S][elect ][Xbox] ![](icon_files/1465752354.png)[.]

[[It's OK to use the word *icon*:]]

-   [In content that teaches beginning Windows skills. ]
-   [When you don't have an image of the icon. ]
-   [In discussions about the icon itself. ]
-   [When you need to differentiate between the ][Start][ icon and the ][Start][ button (a rare occurrence)​. ]

[][Example][
Most apps have their own settings. Look for this icon ]![](icon_files/10090115.PNG) [in the app.]
