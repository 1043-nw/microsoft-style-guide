# icon

Use
only to describe a graphic representation of an object that
a customer can select and open, such as a drive, folder,
document, or app.

Don't use *icon*
to describe graphical dialog box options or options that appear on
ribbons, toolbars, toolboxes, or other areas of a window. For options
that have graphics rather than text labels, use the most descriptive term available, such as *button, box,* or *check box*. To refer to the graphic itself, if there's no other identifying label, use *symbol,* as in *warning symbol.*

Don't use *icon* to refer to the buttons (Back, Start, Search, Volume, Power) on Windows phone.

When referring to an icon, use bold formatting for the icon name. In instructions, use the name of the icon and its image, but don't use the word *icon*.<br /><br />**Example**<br />Select **Xbox** ![](media/icon/1465752354.png).

It's OK to use the word *icon:*

  - In content that teaches beginning Windows skills. 
  - When you don't have an image of the icon. 
  - In discussions about the icon itself. 
  - When you need to differentiate between the **Start** icon and the **Start** button (a rare occurrence)â€‹. 

**Example**<br />Most apps have their own settings. Look for this icon ![](media/icon/10090115.PNG) in the app.
