Use *indent* to refer to a single instance of indentation. For example, use *hanging indent, nested indent, negative indent*, or *positive indent*. 

Use *indentation* to refer to the general concept.

Don't use *outdent.*

Don't use *indenting* or *outdenting into the margin*. Use *extending text into the margin* or *indenting to the previous tab stop* instead.
