# italic

Use only as an adjective, not as a noun. Don't use *italics* or *italicized*.

**Examples**  
To make the selected characters italic, select Ctrl+I.   
The characters are displayed in italic type.

In writing for customers, use *regular type* to describe type that's neither bold nor italic.
