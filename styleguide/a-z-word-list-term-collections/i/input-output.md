Avoid *input/output* in content for a general audience. If you must use it, spell out on the first mention, and then abbreviate as *I/O*.

In content for a technical audience, you don't need to spell out on the first mention.

Use *input/output control* only in content for a technical audience. Always spell out on the first mention. On subsequent mentions, it's OK to abbreviate as *I/O control* or *IOCTL*.
