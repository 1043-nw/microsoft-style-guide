# UK

Avoid using as an abbreviation for *United Kingdom* unless space is limited. 

Don't use as a synonym for *Great Britain (GB)* or *England*. For guidance on when to use each term, look up *UK* in the [PoliCheck terminology database](https://policheck.azurewebsites.net/Pages/DisplayTermDetails.aspx?LCID=9 "PoliCheck term database on Global Readiness website").
