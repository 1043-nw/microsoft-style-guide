In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *un-*, such as *undo* and *unread*, unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion, as in *un-ionized*, or unless *un-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *un-American*. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or consult your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28765).
