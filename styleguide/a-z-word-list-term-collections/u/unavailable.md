Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take rather than describing UI. 

When you must discuss UI, use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead of *unavailable, disabled,* or *grayed* to describe commands and options that are in an unusable state. Use *appears dimmed* if you must describe their appearance. It’s OK to use *unavailable* to describe an outage or a service that isn’t offered to certain customers.  

Examples
The command isn’t available until you select text.
If the option appears dimmed, it's not available.
If the command prompt isn’t available, your network administrator might have turned off this feature.
