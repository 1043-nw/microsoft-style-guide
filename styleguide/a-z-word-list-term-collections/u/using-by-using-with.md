# using, by using, with

In instructions or technical content, use *by using* or *that use* to eliminate ambiguity.

**Examples**  
Refine your pictures by using the photo editor.  
You need Adobe Reader to open files that use the PDF format. 

Don't use *with* as a synonym for *using* or *by using.* It's OK to use *with* in marketing contexts and with product and service names. 

**Example** With OneDrive, you can share your favorite things across your favorite devices, including PCs, Macs, tablets, and phones.
