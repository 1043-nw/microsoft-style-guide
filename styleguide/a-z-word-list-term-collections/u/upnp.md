Don't spell out as *Universal Plug and Play*. Don't use as a synonym for *Plug and Play* or *PnP*.

Use the trademark symbol (™) on the first mention. Include the following in the trademark attribution sentence:

 UPnP™ is a certification mark of the UPnP™ Implementers Corporation.

Use *UPnP* as an adjective followed by *certified*, if appropriate, and a specific term, such as *device**, architecture*, or *standards*.
Example This UPnP certified device features .... 

Don't use *UPnP* to refer to an uncertified device.

Don't use as a noun by itself. For example, don't say, *UPnP is an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity.* Rephrase the sentence as, *The UPnP architecture enables pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity.*

Don't include *UPnP* in the name of any product or in the trademark of any device.

For other guidelines required by the UPnP™ Implementers Corporation, see the [UPnP Implementers Corporation website](http://www.upnp.org/).
