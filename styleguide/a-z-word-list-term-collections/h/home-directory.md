# home directory

Don't use. 

In content for developers, use *root directory*
to refer to the starting point in a hierarchical file structure.
In Windows, the root directory is indicated by a backslash (\\). 

In all other content, use *top-level folder*.

**See also** [root directory](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/r/root-directory)
