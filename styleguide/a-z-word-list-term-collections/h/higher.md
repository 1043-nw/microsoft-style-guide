Don't use *or higher* to mean *or later* to refer to multiple versions of software.

It's OK to use *higher* to refer to display resolution. 

Don't use *higher* to refer to processor speed. Use *faster* instead.

Examples
1920 × 1200 pixels or higher resolution
a processer speed of 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) or faster
