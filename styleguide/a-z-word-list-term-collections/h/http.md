# HTTP

Donâ€™t
spell out unless you're discussing protocols or URLs, or your
audience might be unfamiliar with the abbreviation. When you have a
reason to spell out, use *Hypertext Transfer Protocol.*

Use all uppercase in conceptual discussions of the protocol. 

In general, omit *http://* from a URL. If for some reason you need to include *http://* as part of a URL, use all lowercase.
