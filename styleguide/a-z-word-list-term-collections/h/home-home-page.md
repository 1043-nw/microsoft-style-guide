# home, home page

Use *home* to refer to the main page of a website or the page a browser displays upon opening. Capitalize *Home* only when itâ€™s used as a UI label or in references to a UI label.

Use *home page,* two words, in generic references if needed for clarity.   
**Examples**  
Select **Home** to return to the main portal page.  
Use **Settings** to choose the home page you want to see when the browser opens.

Don't use *start page.*
