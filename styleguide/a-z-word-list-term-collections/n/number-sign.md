Always spell out *number* in *number sign.* Don't use *pound sign.*

Don't use the \# symbol preceding a numeral. Spell out *number* instead. For example, use *number 7*, not *\#7*. When space is limited, as in tables, it's OK to abbreviate *number* as *No*. 

Global tip ****The abbreviation *No.* isn't used to abbreviate *number* in other languages, so using *No.* for this purpose might lead to mistranslation in machine-translated content. 

In social media, it's OK to use the \# symbol to indicate a hashtag. Don't use *number sign* to refer to the hashtag.
Example (on Twitter) A quick look at top conversations and \#Office365 product announcements of the week. [https://sway.com/EZOlxWf5UeFYwIpF](https://sway.com/EZOlxWf5UeFYwIpF "Link to a page related to the tweet subject.")

It's OK to use the \# symbol in references to the \# key on the keyboard.
