Don't use in content for a general audience to refer to selecting multiple items that don't touch. Use *multiple selection* instead, or describe the specific noncontiguous items. 

Use in content for a technical audience only if the term appears in the UI or API. 

Example To select multiple cells, select Ctrl as you select the cells.
