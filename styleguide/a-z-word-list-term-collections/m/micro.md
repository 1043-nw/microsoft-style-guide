In general, don't hyphenate words beginning with *micro-*, such as *microprocessor* and *microsecond*, unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or consult your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28765).
