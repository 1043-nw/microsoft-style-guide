Use to refer to a selection that includes multiple items. It's OK to use *adjacent selection* if you must emphasize that the selected items are adjacent to one another.

Don't use *disjoint selection*, *nonadjacent selection*, or *noncontiguous selection*,
except in content for a technical audience, and only if the term
appears in the UI or API. If you need to refer to nonadjacent selected
items, use *multiple selection* or list the specific items.
