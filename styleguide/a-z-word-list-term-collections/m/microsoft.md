# Microsoft

Never abbreviate *Microsoft*. Don’t use *Microsoft’s.*

**Exception** To avoid awkward wording, it’s OK to use *Microsoft’s* occasionally when you’re referring to the company itself rather than the trademark or brand name.

**Examples**</br>Microsoft software and services</br>Microsoft Surface</br>the Microsoft approach to diversity and inclusion</br>Microsoft’s privacy policies
