# machine

Most of the time, don't use *machine* to mean a computer. Use *computer* instead. It's OK to use *machine*
in content for a technical audience and in content about virtualization
to describe both physical machines and virtual machines.

**Examples**  
Updates help to enhance the security and performance of your computer.  
Move virtual machines from one physical server to another to balance the load among physical servers.  
A signed machine certificate uniquely identifies the computer.
