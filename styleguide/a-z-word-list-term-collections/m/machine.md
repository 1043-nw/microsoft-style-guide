in content for a technical audience and in content about virtualization
to describe both physical machines and virtual machines.

Examples
Updates help to enhance the security and performance of your computer. 
Move virtual machines from one physical server to another to balance the load among physical servers. 
A signed machine certificate uniquely identifies the computer.
