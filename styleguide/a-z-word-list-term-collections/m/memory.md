Always refer to a specific kind of memory, such as *random-access memory (**RAM)**, read-only memory (ROM),* or *hard drive space*. 

Spell out RAM and ROM on the first mention unless you're positive that your audience is familiar with the term.

In the noun forms that refer to memory measurements, use *of* in a prepositional phrase, as in *512 MB of RAM*.
