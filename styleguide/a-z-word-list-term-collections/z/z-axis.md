Lowercase. Hyphenate.

In
3D charts, the z-axis shows depth and generally represents values.
On the first mention, refer to the z-axis as the *value (z) axis*, where both the x-axis and y-axis are category axes. On subsequent mentions, use *z-axis*. 

Don't use italic formatting for the *z* in *z-axis* unless the entire word is italic.
