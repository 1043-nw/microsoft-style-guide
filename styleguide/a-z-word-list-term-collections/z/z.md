# z-

Hyphenate all words referring to entities that begin with *z* used as a separate letter, such as *z-axis, z-coordinate, z-order*, and *z-test.* Refer to your group's editorial style guide for capitalization.

Don't use italic formatting for the *z* in these words unless the entire word is italic.
