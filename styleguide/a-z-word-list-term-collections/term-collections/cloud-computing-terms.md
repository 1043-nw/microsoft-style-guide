# Cloud-computing terms

As
cloud computing evolves, the consistent use of its
terminology across Microsoft content presents a clear story to
customers. 

This section covers common cloud-computing terms. Look up individual cloud service names in the style guides for [](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/LaunchingOfficeNext/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/SKU%20Naming/AllItems.aspx)[Office 365](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/LaunchingOfficeNext/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/SKU%20Naming/AllItems.aspx)[,](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/LaunchingOfficeNext/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/SKU%20Naming/AllItems.aspx)[](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696)[Microsoft Cloud](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696), or [Dynam](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/crmstylecenter/Pages/Product-Names.aspx?a=1 "CRM Style Center: Product names")[ics CRM](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/crmstylecenter/Pages/Product-Names.aspx?a=1 "CRM Style Center: Product names"). (The Office 365 and Dynamics CRM style guides require Microsoft network access.)

Before you
create any new term, check with the applicable brand, marketing, and
engineering teams to find out whether a term already exists. For more
information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see [Use technical terms carefully](/style-guide/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully).

|**Term**|**Usage**|
|---|---|
|**Microsoft Azure, Azure services**|See the <a href="https://worldready.cloudapp.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2696">Microsoft Cloud Style Guide</a>.|
|**cloud**|Don’t capitalize. Don’t use *Microsoft Cloud* or *the Cloud.*<br /><br />Use *cloud* mostly as an adjective. Use sparingly as a noun *(the cloud).*<br /><br />Don’t use *cloud* interchangeably with *internet* or *web*.|
|**cloud platform, cloud services**|Use *cloud platform* only in content for a technical audience, such as content about Azure. In content for a general audience, just refer to cloud services.|
|**community cloud**|Never use. Use *hybrid cloud*, *private cloud*, or *hosted private cloud* instead.|
|**conversations as a platform (CaaP)**|Define the term on the first use, if necessary, to make sure the meaning is clear to your audience.<br /><br />Spell out *conversations as a platform* whenever possible. If the term appears often, it’s OK to use *CaaP* after the abbreviation is introduced in parentheses. Don't capitalize as *CAAP.*<br /><br />Don’t hyphenate *conversations as a platform* when used as a modifier. |
|**dynamic service capacity**|Don't use. Use *elastic service capacity* instead. |
|**Dynamics CRM**|See the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/crmstylecenter/Pages/Product-Names.aspx">Microsoft Dynamics CRM Style Center</a>. (This style guide requires Microsoft network access.)|
|**elastic service capacity**|Use to describe the flexible allocation of computing resources over the internet as demand changes. Define on first mention for audiences that may not be familiar with the concept.|
|**hosted service**|Use to describe a service, an IT solution, or an application that's hosted by a service provider and made available to customers over the internet.|
|**hosting provider, hoster**|It’s OK to use *cloud hosting provider* and *web hosting provider,* if necessary, to distinguish cloud service providers from web hosts. Don’t use *hoster*.|

After that, it’s OK to use *IaaS.* <br /><br />Don’t capitalize as *IAAS.*<br /><br />Don’t hyphenate as a modifier, but include the abbreviated form in parentheses.<br /><br />**Note** Don’t compare IaaS with common utilities, such as power utilities.|
|**IT as a service (ITaaS)**|Use for technical or business-decision-maker audiences only.<br /><br />In content for a general audience, refer to the specific type of service, such as applying software updates, in a cloud-computing model.<br /><br />Spell out on the first mention. After that, it's OK to use *ITaaS*. <br /><br />Don't capitalize as *ITAAS*.|
|**measured service**|Don’t use to describe contractually defined and metered services (often per user or per hour). |
|**Microsoft cloud platform, cloud platform**|Use for technical audiences only. <br /><br /><em>Microsoft cloud platform</em> is sometimes used in marketing to refer to the cloud infrastructure provided by (the combination of) Azure, Windows Server, and System Center.

Learn more about <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise/microsoftcloud/platform/">the Microsoft cloud platform</a>.<br /><br />Always lowercase *cloud* and *platform*.<br /><br />After the first mention, it’s OK to use *cloud platform.*<br /><br />Don’t use *Cloud OS*.|
|**Microsoft cloud services, Microsoft cloud**|Use to refer collectively to Microsoft business and enterprise products, services, and customer experiences that are delivered and consumed in real time over the internet. Don’t use in content and communications for a consumer audience.<br /><br />Always lowercase *cloud* and *services*.<br /><br />After the first mention, it’s OK to use *cloud services from Microsoft* or *cloud services offered by Microsoft.*|
