# Security, safety, and privacy terms

Don???t
use words that imply security, safety, or privacy without
qualification. Instead, focus statements on features. For example,
say *Outlook uses antiphishing technology to scan incoming mail automatically,* not *Outlook helps protect your computer from phishing.*

See [Security, safety, and privacy content](/style-guide/security-safety-privacy-content) for more information.

## Trigger words and qualifiers

If
you must use any of the trigger words in the following table, use
the accompanying qualifiers to avoid promising absolute
security, safety, or privacy. Also, don???t use these terms to
compare Microsoft technology with the competition. 

|**Trigger word**|**How to use**|
|---|---|
|**complete**|more complete|
|**control**|help??control, helps to control, helps you control|
|**ensure**|help ensure, helps to ensure|
|**guard**|helps??guard, helps to guard|
|**private,??privacy**|more private, help protect your privacy, helps to protect your privacy, improve??privacy|

|**safe,??safety, safely**|safer, more safely, improve online safety|
|**secure,??security**|more??secure, help secure, helps to secure, improve security|

Always use qualifiers with trigger words.

## Security terms

This section describes usage for specific security terms. For definitions of security terms, see the [Microsoft Malware Protection Glossary](http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/glossary.aspx). 

**Term**|**Usage**
--|--
**absolute**|Don???t use in discussions about security, safety, or privacy.
**antimalware**|Use only as an adjective to describe a category of software used to detect and respond to malicious software, such as viruses, worms, trojans, and sometimes spyware and adware.
**antiphishing**|Use only as an adjective to describe practices or a category of software used to detect and respond to phishing scams, which are attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
**antispyware**|Use only as an adjective to describe software that detects and sometimes removes spyware.
**antivirus**|Use only as an adjective to describe software that detects and responds to malware.<br />Use *antivirus* instead of *antimalware* to differentiate between antispyware and other antimalware programs. <br />**Example**<br />Microsoft Security Essentials has both antivirus and antispyware capabilities.
**black hat hacker**|Consider alternatives where possible.<br />**Examples**<br />computer criminal<br />unauthorized user<br />malicious hacker 
**bullet-proof**|Don???t use.
**deceptive software**|Don???t use. Use *unwanted software* instead. 
**hacker, hack**|Use *malicious hacker* to refer to an unauthorized user who accesses a system with the intent to cause harm. If the unauthorized user???s intent isn???t known or isn???t malicious, use *unauthorized user*.<br /><br />Don't use *hacker* in content for a general audience. In general use, the term often has negative connotations.<br />It???s OK to use *hack* and *hacker* in content for developers or in contexts where positive outcomes are involved, such as hackathons. Use your judgment and check with [your group???s paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)  <br /><br />Don???t use *hacker* to mean an amateur programmer. Don???t use *hack* to mean improvising a solution to a programming problem unless the positive context is well understood.
**insecure**|Don???t use to mean *not secure*.
**lock**|Don???t use to mean *protect*.
**malicious code**|Don???t use. Use *malware* or *malicious software* instead.
**malicious user**|Don???t use. Use *malicious hacker* instead.
**malware, malicious software**|Use *malware* instead of *malicious software* to describe unwanted software installed without adequate user consent. Viruses, worms, and trojans are malware.<br /><br />If your audience might not be familiar with the term *malware*, define it as *malicious software* on the first mention. <br />**Example**<br />The security filter helps prevent malware (malicious software) from damaging your computer.
**spyware**|Before using the term *spyware* to describe specific software, be certain the software has been identified as spyware.
**total**|Don???t use in discussions about security, safety, and privacy.

**vulnerability**|Don???t use to describe intentional software behavior. For example, don???t describe trusting a domain administrator to control any other domain within a forest as a vulnerability.<br /><br />On the first mention, use a modifier to identify the type of vulnerability:<br /> <ul><li>Product vulnerability is a set of conditions that violates an implied or explicit security policy. A product vulnerability is usually addressed by a Microsoft security bulletin or service pack.</ul></li><ul><li>Administrative vulnerability is the failure to observe administrative best practices. For example, using a weak password or logging on to an account that has more user rights than needed to perform a specific task.</ul></li><ul><li>Physical vulnerability is the failure to provide physical security for a computer. For example, leaving an unlocked computer running and unattended in a public area. </ul></li>After the first mention, it???s OK to use the modifier only occasionally.<br />For other security issues, use the most specific term that describes the issue. Define the term if the audience might be unfamiliar with it. If no specific term exists, use *security issue*.
