In
general, refer to a person who has a kind of disability, not a
disabled person. Use nouns that refer to physical differences
rather than adjectives. For example, say *customers who are blind or have low vision* instead of *blind or vision-impaired customers*. 

Avoid euphemisms like *differently abled* and collective terms that depersonalize entire groups of people, such as *the deaf.* It’s OK to say *he is blind* or *she is deaf.*

If necessary, use the following terms to describe people with disabilities or the disabilities themselves.

To learn more about writing that conveys respect to all people and promotes equal opportunities, see the [Guidelines for Inclusive Language](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/guidelines-inclusive-language "Linguistic Society of America's guidelines for inclusive language") from the Linguistic Society of America.
