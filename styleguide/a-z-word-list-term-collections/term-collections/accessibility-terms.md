[In general, refer to a person who has a kind of disability, not a disabled person. Use nouns that refer to physical differences rather than adjectives. For example, say ]*[customers who are blind or have low vision]*[ instead of ]*[blind or vision-impaired customers]*[. ]

[Avoid euphemisms like *differently abled* and collective terms that depersonalize entire groups of people, such as ]*[the deaf. ]*[It’s OK to say ]*[he is blind]*[ or ]*[she is deaf.]*

[If necessar][y, use the following terms to describe people with disabilities or the disabilities themselves.]

[To learn more about writing that conveys respect to all people and promotes equal opportunities, see the [Guidelines for Inclusive Language](http://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/guidelines-inclusive-language "Linguistic Society of America's guidelines for inclusive language") from the Linguistic Society of America.]
