# Bot terms

In general, avoid talking about bot and AI technology. Instead, focus on benefits or what the customer needs to do. When it’s necessary to use bot terms—such as in content for developers or to make it clear that the customer is chatting with a virtual agent, not a human one—use the terms below.  

Before you invent a term, check with the applicable brand, marketing, and engineering teams to find out whether a term already exists. For more information about creating new terms or using emerging terminology, see [Use technical terms carefully](/style-guide/word-choice/use-technical-terms-carefully).

|**Term**|**Usage**|

|**bot**|Use *bot* to refer to an app that performs automated tasks like scheduling meetings. Don’t use *internet bot* or *web robot.*<br /><br />Use *chatbot* to refer to the type of bot that’s used for human-machine conversation. It’s OK to use *bot* to refer to a chatbot if it’s clear that the bot uses conversation to interact with the customer.<br /><br />Never refer to Cortana as a bot. Use *personal digital assistant* instead.|
|**chatbot**|One word.<br /><br />Use *chatbot,* never *chatterbot,* to refer to a type of bot that engages with humans through a conversational interface.<br /><br />It’s OK to use *bot* to refer to a chatbot if it’s clear that the bot uses conversation to interact with the customer.|
|**conversation as a platform (CaaP)**|Don't use in content for a general audience.<br /><br />OK to use if it’s necessary to refer to the computing model in which two or more people or other entities exchange messages. Define the term on the first use, if necessary, to make sure the meaning is clear to your audience.<br /><br />Spell out *conversation as a platform* whenever possible. If the term appears often, it’s OK to use *CaaP* after the abbreviation is introduced in parentheses. Don't capitalize as *CAAP.*<br /><br />Don’t hyphenate *conversation as a platform* when used as a modifier. |
|**conversational user interface (CUI)**|Avoid the term in customer-facing communications.<br /><br />OK to use if it’s necessary to refer to a computing model where people use text or voice input to interact with a system, similar to a conversation. Define the term on the first use, if necessary, to make sure the meaning is clear to your audience.<br /><br />Spell out *conversational user interface* or *conversational UI* whenever possible. If the term appears often, it’s OK to use *CUI* after the abbreviation is introduced in parentheses.|
|**intelligence, intelligent technology**|Use only to refer to Microsoft products and services that take advantage of AI—for example, "By amplifying human ingenuity and extending our abilities, this intelligent technology empowers us all to achieve more."|
|**personal digital assistant**|Use instead of *agent, virtual assistant,* or *intelligent personal assistant* to refer to Cortana.|
|**social chatbot, relationship chatbot**|Use instead of *emotional chatbot* or *personified chatbot* to refer to a chatbot that people have conversations with for entertainment. Social chatbots often have a name and persona. Zo, Xiaoice, and Rinna are the Microsoft social chatbots.|
|**virtual agent**|Use instead of *virtual support agent, functional chatbot, virtual assistant, support bot,* or *utility bot* to refer to the category of chatbot that assists the user in completing routine or repetitive tasks. It’s OK to use *virtual support agent* if you need to clarify that the purpose of the chatbot is to provide customer or technical support.|
|**voice-activated device**|OK when it’s necessary to refer to the category of devices, such as the Harman Kardon voice-activated speaker, that use Cortana.|
|**voice user interface (VUI)**|Avoid the term in customer-facing communications.<br /><br />OK to use if it’s necessary to refer to a computing model where people use voice input to interact with a system, similar to a conversation.
