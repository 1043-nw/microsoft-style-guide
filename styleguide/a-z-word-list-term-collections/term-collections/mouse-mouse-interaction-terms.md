[Most of the time, don't talk about the mouse, mouse actions, or the pointer unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. Instead, talk about customer interactions with the UI. To learn more, see [Describing interactions with UI](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26472).]

[When you need to talk specifically about the mouse, mouse interactions, or the pointer, use these terms.]
