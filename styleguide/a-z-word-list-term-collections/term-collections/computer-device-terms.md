[In the modern world, customers get things done with whatever device is handy. When you write, focus on what the customer wants to accomplish. If you must write about the device itself, use the most general term that works—][[usually, that’s ]*device*[. Sometimes, it’s ]*computer,* *phone,* [or ]*wearable device*[. Occasionally, it’s ]*laptop*[, ]*smartphone*[, or ]*fitness* *band.*]

[When you need to discuss specific hardware made by Microsoft, refer to that product group's editorial style guide for correct spelling and capitalization. If the product is available for retail purchase, alone or as part of another product, refer to the ][[Microsoft Store]](http://www.microsoftstore.com/)[[[ for product and component names. ]]]

[Microsoft technology is used in a range of hardware products developed by our partners, from computers and phones to point-of-sale devices and kiosks to cars. For information about referring to these products, contact the team that provides the technology to the hardware partner.][ ]
