# Computer and device terms

In
the modern world, customers get things done with whatever device
is handy. When you write, focus on what the customer wants to
accomplish. If you must write about the device itself, use the most
general term that works—usually, that’s *device*. Sometimes, it’s *computer,* *phone,* or *wearable device*. Occasionally, it’s *laptop*, *smartphone*, or *fitness* *band.*

When
you need to discuss specific hardware made by Microsoft, refer to
that product group's editorial style guide for correct spelling and
capitalization. If the product is available for retail purchase,
alone or as part of another product, refer to the [Microsoft Store](http://www.microsoftstore.com/) for product and component names. 

Microsoft
technology is used in a range of hardware products developed by
our partners, from computers and phones to point-of-sale devices
and kiosks to cars. For information about referring to these
products, contact the team that provides the technology to the
hardware partner. 

## Device interaction terms

Use these verbs to talk about using devices and peripheral devices:

  - Use *turn on* and *turn off,* not *power on,* *power off, switch on,* or *switch off.*
  - Use *set up* to describe preparing hardware or software for first use.
  - Use *install* and *uninstall* to refer to adding and removing hardware drivers and apps. 
  - Use *connect* and *disconnect* to
    refer to establishing a relationship between devices (direct or
    wireless) and connecting a device to a network or the internet.

## Preferred device terms

**Term**|**Usage**
--|--
**device, mobile device**|Use *device* to refer collectively to all types of computers, phones, and other devices. <br /><br />Use *mobile device* only when you need to call out the mobility.<br /><br />It’s OK to modify *device* when it matters. For example, *point-of-sale device*.
**computer, PC**|Use *computer* in the uncommon event that you need to talk about computing devices other than phones, wearable devices, and gaming consoles.<br /><br />It’s also OK to use *PC* when space is a constraint, but don’t switch between *PC* and *computer*.<br /><br />Don't use *desktop* as a synonym for *PC* or *computer*.<br /><br />Don’t use *mobile computer*, *portable computer*, or *mobile PC*.
**phone, mobile phone, smartphone**|Use *phone* most of the time. <br /><br />If you need to call out the mobility, use *mobile phone*.<br /><br />Use *smartphone* only if you need to distinguish a smartphone from other types of phones. <br /><br />Don't use *wireless phone*, *cell phone*, or *cellular phone*.
**tablet, laptop**|Use a more generic term unless you’re talking about a specific class of computers. Use *tablet* only to refer to a touchscreen computer without a permanently attached keyboard. Use *laptop* to refer to a portable computer with a permanently attached keyboard, with or without a touchscreen.
**wearable device, fitness band**|Use only when it’s necessary to differentiate devices that are meant to be worn from other devices. To avoid confusion with the Microsoft Band product, avoid using *band* by itself as a noun.<br /><br />Avoid using *wearable* as a noun.

## Acceptable terms for specific references

Use the following terms only when you need to be more specific than you can be by using the preferred terms.

**Term**|**Usage**
--|--
**handheld device**|Use only to refer to a small, limited-use device that accesses, captures, and updates information in real time, such as the devices often used in line-of-business (LOB) applications. If possible, just use *device*. <br /><br />Don’t use *handheld* as a noun.<br /><br />Don’t use *handheld PC* or *handheld computer*.
**slate**|Don’t use.
**notebook**|Don’t use.
**machine**|Use only to describe both physical computers and virtual machines in content about virtualization.
**client or server, box**|Use *client* or *server* only if it's clear to the reader whether the client or server discussed is hardware or software.<br /><br />Use *client* or *server computer* if you need to clarify that you're discussing hardware.<br /><br />Don’t use *box* in reference to client and server hardware.

## **Peripheral devices and hardware components**

In general, use the most generic term that describes a peripheral device or hardware component. 

**Term**|**Usage**
--|--
**adapter**|Use instead of *adaptor*.
**disc**|Use *disc*, not *disk*, to refer to a CD or DVD. <br /><br />Don't use *disk*, *fixed disk*, *hard disk*, or *disk drive*. Instead, use *hard drive* to refer to the drive on a PC where programs are typically stored.
**display, screen, monitor**|Use *display* as a general term for any visual output device, including the built-in display on a computing device and an external monitor or projector.<br /><br />Use *screen* to distinguish the usable portion of the display from its edges.<br /><br />Use *monitor* only when you need to refer specifically to a standalone desktop or mounted display device that can be connected to a computing device.
**drive**|Avoid talking about drives when you can. It’s enough to prompt customers to save a file, picture, song, and so on. <br /><br />Use *drive* as the general term for any type of device or service where a customer can save or retrieve files, including *hard drive*, *CD drive*, *DVD drive*, *USB flash drive*, or any other removable storage device. Avoid referring to the specific type of drive if you can. <br /><br />Don't use *disk drive*.<br /><br />Use *hard drive* to refer to a drive on a PC where programs are typically stored. Don’t use hard disk.<br /><br />Use *drive C*, not *drive C:*, *drive C>*, or *C: drive*, when necessary. <br /><br />Use *network drive*, not *remote drive*, to refer to a logical network drive name. <br />**Example** network drive X
**input device, mouse, pen, controller, joystick, touchpad, trackball**|In general, don’t talk about specific input devices. Most of the time, talk about how the customer interacts with the app or game by selecting, choosing, and so on. To learn more, see [Describing interactions with UI](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26472).<br /><br />Don’t use *pointing device* or *input device*. When you must discuss interacting with a specific type of device, use the specific term for that device: *mouse*, *pen*, *controller*, *trackball*, or *joystick*. Joysticks have *controls* (not options) for controlling movement on the screen.<br /><br />When you need to refer to a specific input device made by Microsoft, refer to your group's style guide. If the product is available for retail purchase, alone or as part of another product, refer to the [Microsoft Store](http://www.microsoftstore.com/) for product and component names.
**network adapter**|Use instead of *network card* to describe hardware that supports connecting a computer to a network.
**pen, stylus**|Use *tablet pen* on first mention, and *pen thereafter*. If you're talking specifically about Surface Pen, use *Microsoft Surface Pen* on the first mention. <br /><br />Don’t use *stylus*.
**touchscreen**|One word. Use sparingly. Most of the time, talk about how the customer interacts with the app or product by selecting, choosing, and so on. See [Describing interactions with UI](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=26472) to learn more.
**USB**|Don’t spell out. Use only as an adjective. <br />**Examples**<br />USB drive<br />USB hub<br />USB 3.0 port
