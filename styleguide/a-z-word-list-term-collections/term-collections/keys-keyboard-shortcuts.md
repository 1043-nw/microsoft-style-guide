#### [[Special character names]]{}

[Because special character names could be confused with an action (such as +) or be difficult to see, always spell out the following special character names: *Plus sign, Minus sign, Hyphen, Period,* and *Comma*. ]

[To avoid confusion, it's OK to add the character in parentheses after spelling out the name.
][Example ][Plus sign (+) ]

[Use discretion. This might not be necessary for commonly used characters, such as the period (.).]

[To show a key combination that includes punctuation requiring use of the Shift key, such as the question mark, use *Shift* and the name or symbol of the shifted key. Using the name of the unshifted key, such as *4* rather than *\$,* could be confusing or even wrong. For example, the *?* and */* characters aren't shifted keys on every keyboard. Always spell out *Plus sign, Minus sign, Hyphen, Period,* and *Comma*.]

[Examples]**
**[Ctrl+Shift+?  ]
[Ctrl+Shift+\*  ]
[Ctrl+Shift+Comma]
