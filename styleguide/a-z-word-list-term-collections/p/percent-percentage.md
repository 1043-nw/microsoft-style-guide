One word. Spell out unless space is constrained. When spelling out *percent*, insert a space between the number and the word. 

It's OK to use the percent sign (%):

  - In data-intensive content, such as tables, charts, and dashboards.
  - To save space in UI (such as in controls).
  - As a technical symbol. 

Always use a numeral with *percent*, no matter how small. 

Examples
At least 50 percent of your system resources should be available.
Only 1 percent of the test group was unable to complete the task. 

Exception
When you use *percent*
in column headings to name the rate percent term in the percentage
formula (base \* rate percent = percentage), you can use *percent* without a numeral. (See the following examples.)

Use *percentage:*

  - When you don't specify a quantity, such as in the phrase *a large percentage of system resources.*
  - When applying the percentage formula (base \* rate percent = percentage)*.*

Examples**
**

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><b>List price</b></td>
<td><b>Discount percent</b></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$200</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

10.00 USD is the percentage discount calculated by applying a 10 percent discount to a list price of 100.00 USD. $100.00 \* 10% = $10.00. 

  - 10 percent is the percent discount. 
  - $10.00 is the percentage discount.
