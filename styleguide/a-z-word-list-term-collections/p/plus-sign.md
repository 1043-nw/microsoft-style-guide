Don’t use the plus sign (+) to replace words like *and, over,* and *plus.*

Exception
Where space is limited, like in UI or a headline, it’s OK to use the
plus sign to indicate a count that exceeds a certain number.

Examples 
Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Office 365 are better together.
Choose from more than 750,000 apps in the Windows Store.
999+ connections (in the UI)
