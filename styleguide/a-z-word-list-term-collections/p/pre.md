# pre-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *pre-*, such as *preallocate* and *preempt*, unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion, as in *pre-engineered*, or if *pre-* is followed by a proper noun, as in *pre-C++*. When in doubt, refer to [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or refer to your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens).
