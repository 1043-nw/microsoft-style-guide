Use
only to refer to the separate areas of a split or single window. For
example, in File Explorer, the names of all the folders sometimes appear
in one pane and the contents of a selected folder in another pane.

If a pane isn't labeled in the UI, use lowercase for the name that describes it, such as *the annotation pane*. If a pane is labeled in the UI, follow the capitalization used in the UI. For example, *the Score pane*.
