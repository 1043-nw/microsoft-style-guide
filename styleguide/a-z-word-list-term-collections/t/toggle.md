# toggle

Use as an adjective, as in *toggle key*. A toggle key turns a particular mode on or off.

Don't use as a verb. Instead, use *switch,* *turn on,* or *turn off* with the name of the toggle key or command to describe what the customer should do. 

**Examples**  
Use the Caps lock key to switch from typing capital letters to typing lowercase letters.  
To switch between Normal, Outline, and Slide Sorter views, use the buttons on the View tab.
