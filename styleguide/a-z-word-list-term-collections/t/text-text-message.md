Use as an adjective, a noun, or a verb in the context of SMS messages. Use *text message* and *send* or *receive* *a text message*, if necessary, to avoid ambiguity. 

Use *text* or *text message* rather than *SMS* (short message service) or *MMS* (multimedia
messaging service) for the US audience. For markets where SMS may be
the more common usage, localization teams will use the appropriate term.

**Global tip**  In some languages, *text* is translated differently as a noun and a verb. Provide enough context for localization to determine how to translate *text.* For example, instead of *text a friend,* say *send a text to a friend* or *text a quick message to a friend.*
