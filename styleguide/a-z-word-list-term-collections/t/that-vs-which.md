Use *that* at the beginning of a clause that’s necessary for the sentence to make sense. Don’t put a comma before *that.*

Global tip Include *that* even if the sentence is clear without it. It helps to clarify the sentence structure.

Use *which*
at the beginning of a clause that adds supporting or parenthetical
information. If you can omit the clause and the sentence still makes
sense, use *which,* and put a comma before it.
