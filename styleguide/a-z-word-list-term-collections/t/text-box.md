Refer to a box in which the user enters text only by its label. If you must use a descriptor, use *box*. Don't use *field* or *entry field*, except in content about database programs.

Examples
File name box
Enter or update an email address for Work email.

In content for developers, it's OK to use *text box* in content about designing and developing the UI.
