# text box

Refer to a box in which the user enters text only by its label. If you must use a descriptor, use *box*. Don't use *field* or *entry field*, except in content about database programs.

**Examples**  
**File name** box  
Enter or update an email address for **Work email**.

In content for developers, it's OK to use *text box* in content about designing and developing the UI.
