Refer to Taiwan only as *Taiwan*, never as *Republic of China* or *ROC*. If you must abbreviate *Taiwan*, the ISO abbreviation is *TWN*.

See the [official country/region list](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Lists/CountryRegion/CountryRegionList.aspx "Official country/region list on GPWeb") and [how to refer to Taiwan](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/KBLibrary/1001.docx?web=1) on the [Global Readiness website](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/Pages/Home.aspx)
