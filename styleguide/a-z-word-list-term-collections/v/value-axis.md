# value axis

Lowercase. Don't hyphenate.

Usually
refers to the vertical axis in 2D charts and graphs, which shows
the values being measured or compared. Refer to it as the *value (y) axis* on the first mention. On subsequent mentions, use *y-axis*. It's OK to use *vertical (y) axis* in content for a general audience.

Don't use italic formatting for the *y* in *y-axis* unless the entire word is italic.

In 3D charts, the z-axis is usually the value axis.
