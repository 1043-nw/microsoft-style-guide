Two words. **

In general, avoid talking about UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. 

When you need to help a customer interact with UI, refer to a list box by its label and the word *list*, not *list box*. For the Mac, use *pop-up list* to refer to unnamed list boxes.

Examples**
**In the Background list, select Coffee Bean. 
In the pop-up list, select Microsoft Excel. (Mac only)
