# later

If possible, use a hyperlink to help readers find information elsewhere in the content. If you can't use a hyperlink, use *later* instead of *below* in cross-references such as *later in this topic.*

It's OK to use *or later* to refer to multiple versions of software. Keep in mind that the phrases *or later* and *and later*
might imply that the functionality or feature discussed will be
included or supported in all future releases. If you're not sure, list
each applicable version instead.

Examples
Internet Explorer 7 or later, Firefox 3.6 or later
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10****
