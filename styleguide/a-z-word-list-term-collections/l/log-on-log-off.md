# log on, log off

Don't use *log on, logon, log off, logoff, log in, login, log onto, log off of, log out,* or *logout* unless these terms appear in the UI (and you're writing instructions). 

Use *sign in* or *sign out* instead.

**See** [sign in, sign out](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/sign-in-sign-out), [connect](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/s/sign-in-sign-out)
