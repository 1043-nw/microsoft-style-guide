Download topic

Don't use as a synonym for *start, install, run, set up,* or *download.*

In content for a technical audience, use *load* only to
describe dynamically calling graphics, documents, or installed programs
or data, such as drivers, DLLs, scripts, registry entries, and
profiles, into RAM or a program's virtual memory. Use *unload* or *remove* to refer to removing these items from memory.

For games, use *load* to refer to continuing gameplay at the last place that a game was saved. *Load game* and *Load saved game* are typical button labels for game UI.

Examples
Load the device driver into the upper memory area.
Loading your personal settings ... (system status message)
When you sign in, the app loads your profile.
Run the program in character mode.
Setting up Office 365 (heading)
Download the e-book (link text)
When you're ready to play again, load your saved game.
