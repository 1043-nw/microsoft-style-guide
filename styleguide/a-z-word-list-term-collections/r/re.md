In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *re-* unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion or *re-* is followed by a proper noun. When in doubt, refer to [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or consult your group's editorial style guide.

Examples**
**reenter 
recover (to get back or regain) 
re-cover (to cover again) 
recreate (to take part in a recreational activity) 
re-create (to create anew)

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28765).
