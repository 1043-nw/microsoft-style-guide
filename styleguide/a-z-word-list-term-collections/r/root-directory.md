# root directory

In content for developers, use *root directory*, not *home directory*, to refer to the directory or folder from which all other directories or folders branch. In Windows, the root directory is indicated by a backslash (\\). Don’t shorten to *root* when you mean the directory.

In other content, use *top-level folder*.

Example Change to the root directory, and enter the following command: edit autoexec.bat
