# root directory

In content for developers, use *root directory*, not *home directory*, to refer to the directory or folder from which all other directories or folders branch. In Windows, the root directory is indicated by a backslash (\\). Donâ€™t shorten to *root* when you mean the directory.

In other content, use *top-level folder*.

**Example** Change to the root directory, and enter the following command: **edit autoexec.bat**

**See also**  [top-level folder](/style-guide/a-z-word-list-term-collections/t/top-level-folder)
