It's OK to use *we recommend* to introduce a Microsoft recommendation. Don't use *Microsoft recommends *or *it is recommended*.

Don't use *recommend* when something is required.

Examples
Windows 10 requires 16 GB of hard drive space for 32-bit OS and 20 GB for 64-bit OS.
Small
storage devices, like devices with 32-GB hard drives or older devices
with full hard drives, might require additional storage to complete
the upgrade. If you have limited hard drive space available, we
recommend that you have a USB flash drive handy when you install
Windows 10.
