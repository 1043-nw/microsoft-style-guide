Use *radio button* only in content for developers in which the API includes the term. In that case, use wording such as *\<name\> option button *(also known as a *radio button*).

In other content, refer to a radio button by its label. If you must provide a descriptor, use *option*. Capitalize the label text as it appears in the UI, but don't capitalize the word *option*.
