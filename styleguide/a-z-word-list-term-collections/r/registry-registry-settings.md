Use lowercase for the word *registry* except when referring to a named system component, such as the Registry Editor. 

Use
all uppercase letters for the first-level subtrees,
separating words with underscore characters. Registry subtrees are
usually bold.

Examples**
**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT 
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE

Keys
are developer defined and are usually all uppercase or a mix of
uppercase and lowercase characters, with no underscores. Subkeys are
usually a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.

Examples**
**SOFTWARE 
ApplicationIdentifier 
Application Identifier*Name* **
**stockfile 
the new program subkey

Refer to an entire subkey path as a *subkey*, not a *path*. 

Example**
**(typical subkey ) \\HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Jet\\3.5\\Engines\\Xbase subkey

In a subkey, use *entries* to describe the items in the Name column. Use *values* to describe the items in the Data column.
