Use *rights*
only in a nonspecific way to refer to system actions that are
authorized by the system administrator. For specific references, use *user rights*.

Don't confuse *rights*, which apply to system operations, with *permissions*, which apply to specific system resources, such as files or printers.

Don't use *privileges* as a synonym for *rights*.

Example Domain administrators should use a primary user account, which has basic user rights in the domain.
