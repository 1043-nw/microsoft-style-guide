# command line, command-line

Two words as a noun. Hyphenate as an adjective.

**Examples**  
command-line parameter   
command-line tool

Customers enter commands *at* a *command prompt*, not *on* a *command line.*

It's OK to use *on the command line* in the context of building apps using command-line tools in Visual Studio.

Use *command-line program* in content for a general audience. Use *console application* only in content for a technical audience.
