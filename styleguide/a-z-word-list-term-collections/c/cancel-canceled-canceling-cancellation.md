# cancel, canceled, canceling, cancellation

Use *cancel the selection* instead of *deselect* or *unmark*. Use *clear* to refer to check boxes.

Use *cancel* to describe ending code requests and processes before they're complete.

Spell *canceled* and *canceling* with one l, but spell *cancellation* with two l's.
