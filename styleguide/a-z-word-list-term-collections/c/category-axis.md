# category axis

Lowercase. Don't hyphenate.

Refer to the *category (x) axis* on the first mention. On subsequent mentions, use *x-axis*. It's OK to use *horizontal (x) axis* in content for a general audience.

In 3D charts, both the x-axis and y-axis are usually category axes*.* 

Don't use italic formatting for the *x* in *x-axis* or the *y* in *y-axis* unless the entire word is italic.
