# co-

In general, don’t hyphenate words beginning with *co-*, such as *coauthor* and *coordinate*, unless it’s necessary to avoid confusion. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/) or refer to your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](/style-guide/punctuation/dashes-hyphens/hyphens).
