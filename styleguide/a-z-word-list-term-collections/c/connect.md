Use *connect*, *make a connection*, and similar phrases to describe attaching a computer to a network, whether intranet or internet.

Don't use *connect* as a synonym for *sign in* or ** *map*, as in mapping a drive letter to a shared network folder. But use *d**i**sconnect* to describe removing a mapped network drive.
