# country or region

Use instead of *country*
for list headings, descriptions, and other contexts that might include
named dependencies or disputed territories. In general discussions, use
just *country.* Don't use *geography* or *geo* as a synonym for *country* or *country or region.*

**Examples**  
This product isn't available in some countries.  
Enter your country or region.

It's OK to use *country/region* where space is limited. Capitalize both words if the context requires *country* to be capitalized. For example, if *country/region* is used as a label in a form, capitalize as *Country/Region.*

*Country or region* and *country/region* have no particular legal meaning. In a legal document, legal staff should determine how to refer to countries and regions. 

For the official list of countries and regions and more information about using *country,* visit the [Microsoft Global Readiness website](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/KBLibrary/1000.docx?web=1 "Global Readiness Knowledge Base")[.](https://globalready.azurewebsites.net/KBArticle/ViewHtmlPage/1 "Global Readiness Knowledge Base")
