[Use instead of ]*[country]*[ for list headings, descriptions, and other contexts that might include named dependencies or disputed territories. In general discussions, use just *country.* Don't use *geography* or *geo* as a synonym for *country* or *country or region.*]

[[]][Examples][**
**This product isn't available in some countries. 
][Enter ][your country or region.]

[It's OK to use ]*[country/region ]*[where space is limited. Capitalize both words if the context requires *country* to be capitalized. For example, if *country/region* is used as a label in a form, capitalize as *Country/Region.*]

*[C][ountry or region ]*[and ]*[country/region]*[ have no particular legal meaning. In a legal document, legal staff should determine how to refer to countries and regions. ]

[For the official list of countries and regions ][[and more information about using ]*country,* [visit the ]][[Microsoft Global Readiness website]](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/celaGlobalReadiness/KBLibrary/1000.docx?web=1 "Global Readiness Knowledge Base")[[.](https://globalready.azurewebsites.net/KBArticle/ViewHtmlPage/1 "Global Readiness Knowledge Base")]
