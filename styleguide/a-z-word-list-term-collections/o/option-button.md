In general, avoid talking about the UI. Instead, talk about what the customer needs to do. Refer to an option by its UI label only. If you must provide a descriptor, use *option*. Use the exact label text, including its capitalization, but don't capitalize the word *option.*

Avoid
referring to the option button itself. Just discuss the option that it
controls. When you must mention the button for clarity, use *option button*.

Examples
Select No header row.
When you select the Keep source formatting option, ....
For Paste options, select Keep text only.

In content for a technical audience, some product teams use *option* instead of *switch* to refer to a command argument or compiler option, such as /b or /Za. Refer to your group's editorial style guide.
