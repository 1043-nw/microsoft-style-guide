# open source, open-source

Lowercase unless you're talking about the Open Source Initiative. 

Hyphenate *open-source* as an adjective preceding a noun, as in *open-source software.* Don't use *open-sourced* as an adjective*.*

Don't hyphenate in other instances, such as *Open source is a development model in which ....*

Don't use *OSS* as an abbreviation for *open-source software.*
