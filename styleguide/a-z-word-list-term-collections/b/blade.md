# blade

Avoid talking about blades. Instead, try to discuss what the customer needs to do. 

When you must mention a blade:

  - Define *blade* on the first mention.  
  
  - Always name the blade except in general references to a blade or blades.  
  
  - Use sentence-style capitalization for the blade name.<br />    **Example** <br />the **Resource group** blade
    
  - Donâ€™t capitalize *blade,* but always include *blade* in the blade title or subtitle.  
  
  - In a blade title or subtitle, use a plus sign (+) instead of *and* or an ampersand (&). Include a space on each side of the plus sign.  
  
  - Add an article, such as *a* or *the,* to a blade name that consists of a verb and a singular noun.<br />    **Example** <br />Add a connector blade. (Not *Add connector blade.*)  
  
  - Use *on* to describe the contents of a blade.<br />    **Example** <br />On the **Web app** blade, name your site.  
  
  - Use *open* and *close* as verbs with blades.
