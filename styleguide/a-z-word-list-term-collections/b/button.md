Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. 

When you need to discuss UI elements, use *button* instead of *command button,* *option button, *or *action button*. If possible, refer to a button by its label only without using the word *button*. If you need to use the word *button* for clarity, *button* is lowercase. For example, references to an unnamed button such as Maximize may be clearer if you describe it as *the Maximize button*. 

Examples
Select a file, and then select OK.
To enlarge a window to fill the entire screen, select the Maximize button.
