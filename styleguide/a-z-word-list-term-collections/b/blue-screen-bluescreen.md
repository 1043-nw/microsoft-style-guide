Don't use *blue screen* or *bluescreen*, either as a noun or as a verb, to refer to an operating system that's not responding. As a verb, use *stop*. As noun, use *stop error*.

It's OK to use *blue screen* (two words) to refer to the screen display itself.

Example The operating system stopped unexpectedly, and an error message appeared on a blue screen.
