# browse

Use to refer to manually scanning internet sites or other files. To describe using the search feature of an app, product, or service, or using an internet search engine, use *find* or *search.*

If your app, product, or service refers to the ellipsis button as the **Browse** button, use *browse* to describe the customer action associated with the button.

It's OK to use *browse the web,* but use *browse through* a list, database, document, or similar item.
