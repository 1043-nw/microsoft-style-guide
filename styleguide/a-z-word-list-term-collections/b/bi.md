In general, don't hyphenate words beginning with *bi-*, such as *bidirectional*, *bimodal*, and *bimonthly*, unless it's necessary to avoid confusion. When in doubt, check [*The American Heritage Dictionary*](https://ahdictionary.com/), or consult your group's editorial style guide.

To learn more about hyphenation, see [Hyphens](https://worldready.cloudapp.net/Styleguide/Read?id=2700&topicid=28765).
