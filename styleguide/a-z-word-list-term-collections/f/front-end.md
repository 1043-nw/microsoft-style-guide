# front end, front-end

In
content for a general audience, don't use as a synonym for
the desktop interface to a database or server. Instead, refer
to the program by name, or use *interface*, *program*, *app,* or another specific and accurate term instead. It's OK to use these terms in content for a technical audience. 

Two words as a noun. Hyphenate as an adjective.
