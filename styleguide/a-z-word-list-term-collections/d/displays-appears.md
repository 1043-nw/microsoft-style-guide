# displays, appears

*Displays* requires both a subject (the thing doing the displaying) and a direct object (the thing being displayed). *Appears* doesn't require an object. 

Avoid using *is displayed*. It's passive.

**Examples**  
If you try to close the program without saving the file, a message appears.   
Word displays a message if you try to close the program without saving the file. 

**See** [Computer and device term collection](~/a-z-word-list-term-collections/term-collections/computer-device-terms.md) for information about using *display* as a noun.
