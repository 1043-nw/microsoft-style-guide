# dialog box, dialog

Most of the time, avoid talking about UI elements. Talk about customer actions instead.

When you need to refer to a dialog box, use *dialog box*—don’t shorten to *dialog.* Don't use *pop-up window* or *dialogue box*.

Don't hyphenate *dialog box* as a modifier.

**Examples**  
Word can’t open this document because a dialog box is open. Close the dialog box to continue.  
Select the **Paragraph** dialog box launcher, and then select **Tabs**. Enter the position on the ruler where you want to set the tab stop.  

**Exception** In content for developers, it's OK to use *dialog* by itself as a modifier. For example, "This article provides information about the dialog form pattern."
