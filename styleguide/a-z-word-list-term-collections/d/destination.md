Use a more precise term, such as *website* or *folder,* to
describe an end point, such as the location reached when a
customer clicks a hyperlink, the folder to which a file is copied or
moved, or the document in which a linked or embedded object is
stored. Use *destination* as a modifier only if necessary for clarity.

Don't use *target* as a synonym.
