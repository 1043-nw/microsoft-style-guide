Don't use *drag and drop* except as an adjective to describe behavior that a programmer puts in a program, such as *drag-and-drop editing* or *drag-and-drop feature*. Use *move* or *drag* instead.

Don't use *click and drag.* It's OK to use *press and drag* to teach mouse techniques in content that teaches beginning skills.
