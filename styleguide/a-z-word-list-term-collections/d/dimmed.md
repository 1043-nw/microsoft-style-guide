[Most of the time, talk about the actions that customers should take rather than describing UI.]

[Don’t use to describe commands or options that are in an unusable state—use *not available* or *isn’t available* instead. It’s OK to use *appears dimmed* if you must describe their appearance. Use *shaded* to describe the appearance of check boxes that represent a mixture of settings.]

[Examples]
[The command isn't available until you select text.]
[If the option appears dimmed, it's not availab][le.
Selected effects appear shaded.]
