# Hashtags

Hashtags provide context and draw readers into conversations on Twitter and other social media and in Outlook. 

Follow these guidelines to use hashtags effectively and in a positive way.

Keep your hashtags short (4 to 10 characters), and make them easy to remember and easy to spell. 

Examples
\#MSIgnite
\#MinecraftEdu

Use hashtags that are easy to use in a sentence. Nouns work better than verbs.

Example Good morning, Atlanta\! \#MSIgnite starts in 1 hour\!

Make it simple and straightforward. Don’t overthink your hashtag or get cute or complicated. Your hashtag should be immediately understandable.

When selecting a hashtag, always check to see how others are using it.
In some cases, it’s helpful to use a hashtag that’s already being used
by others, such as \#AI or \#IoT, to draw readers who are interested in
that topic. You might also find that a competitor or bad actor is
already using a hashtag in a way that isn’t ideal or positive for the
Microsoft brand.
