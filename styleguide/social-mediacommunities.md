The
web has evolved from a source of information to a place
where people share expertise and learn from others. Customers
expect to interact with digital content. 

Consider
offering customers a way to provide content on your site—all
customers, or a few you select. If you do, establish submission
standards and have a plan in place to manage content for
appropriateness, accuracy, and adherence to standards. It’s a good
idea to contact [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) and your [Global Readiness contact](https://globalready.azurewebsites.net/Pages/Contacts) before launching a new community submission program. (These pages require Microsoft network access.)

There
are plenty of ways for customers to contribute content, from
commenting to submitting media, tips, templates, and more. Microsoft
hosts [community forums](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us) for many programs. They're a great way to see what’s on your customers’ minds. 

Most
community programs have editors, content managers, or councils in
place to ensure that content is appropriate, to encourage submissions
and conversations, to arbitrate disagreements, and to respond to
feedback. Make sure you have the time and resources to manage a
community program before you begin. 

An
enthusiastic community, such as a highly engaged
technical community with lots of expertise to share, is a good
place to start. Include employees with expertise, such as program
managers, developers, marketers, support, sales, or anyone else
with expertise and a vested interest.

Community content can include:

  - Troubleshooting and workarounds
  - Tips and tricks
  - Best practices
  - Interoperability information
  - Scenario-based or solution-based content
  - Product evaluations
  - Beta content
  - White papers
  - Community or wiki lists
  - Learning road maps

Wikis, such as the [TechNet wiki](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/), are
a great way to collaborate with customers and your internal
community on content that Microsoft might not otherwise provide. For
content that can't be released yet, use a private wiki with limited
participants. Start
your wiki with an idea of how you'll organize the content. Most
wikis don’t have a standard table of contents, but you can create one or
more navigation articles to provide links to other articles. 

To encourage contribution, create *stub topics:* partially
completed topic drafts that the community can add to. Start with
content that encourages contribution, such as troubleshooting or
tips and tricks, and experiment from there. Make sure your product,
legal, and localization contacts support your efforts, and be open
to change based on community feedback. 

If
tagging is available on the community platform, tag entries with
keywords to help readers find related entries and search for
posts about topics they care about.

Use social media to promote interesting content and to encourage community contributions.
