# Code names

Before you create or use code names for existing products, new offerings, or acquisitions, review CELAWeb [Code name guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Code-Names). (This page requires Microsoft network access.)

In external communications, use the final name for the product
rather than a code name if possible. A code name must be approved
by someone with P\&L authority and
by the Microsoft Brand Studio before it can be used in
external communications. Submit the proposed code name to the [Brand Central Help Center](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral/Helpcenter) or your Brand team contact for approval. (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 

If your code name is approved, follow CELA guidelines for [using code names in external communications](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Code-Names). (This page requires Microsoft network access.) 

Avoid using code names in documentation. If you must use a code name:

  - Try to limit use to topic titles or regular text. 
  - Never use code names in file names, art, context IDs, or link text. 
  - Be careful to replace all instances of the code name when the official name is confirmed.
