Accurate
system requirements for products, services, and downloads enhance
the customer experience as well as minimize legal risk. This
is true for trial, evaluation, and prerelease or beta products,
too. 

There are plenty of
options for documenting system requirements. Starting with system
requirements from the previous version can speed things up.
Keep these guidelines in mind:

  - Follow the [System requirements guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Marketing/Packaging/System-Requirements) on CELAWeb, and discuss your ideas with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx). (These pages require Microsoft network access.) 
  - If
    customers obtain a product digitally, make sure the system
    requirements are available via a prominent link on the purchase or
    download page. It’s a good idea to create a webpage for system
    requirements for packaged products, too.
