# Product previews

Prerelease versions of software and services are typically identified as *Product Name Preview* (preferred) or *Code Name Preview.*

In generic references, lowercase *preview.*

Avoid using *beta* to refer to a prerelease product that's ready for unstructured testing by customers. Use *preview* instead.

**Examples**  
Office 2016 Preview  
Windows 10 Insider Preview  
Microsoft Power BI Preview  
A preview of Azure Container Service is available.  

Previews are subject to different terms and conditions than major releases. Check with [your group's paralegal](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Pages/Applications/LegalContact.aspx) for details. (This page requires Microsoft network access.)
